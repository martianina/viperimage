summary: 'Can DeSci help redheads verify and access safer, more effective sunscreen formulas the FDA has neglected for decades?'
---

Redheads are told to use sunscreen constantly—but what if we don’t trust it?  
U.S. sunscreen formulas feel toxic, haven’t been updated in decades, and better filters exist abroad.  
Can DeSci help us find and verify safer, more effective options for those who need it most?

### The Problem  
The FDA hasn’t approved a new sunscreen filter since 1999. Redheads are at high risk for melanoma due to MC1R.  
Better filters exist overseas. Research on long-term chemical exposure is limited—especially for lifelong daily users.

### What We Can Do  
DeSci can catalog international studies, fund side-by-side safety reviews, and generate redhead-specific product guidance.  
We can also crowdsource reactions and preferences through micro studies.

### The Vision  
Sunscreen isn’t optional for redheads—but trust is.  
If we organize our data, we can create safer, smarter protection—and help others too.

### Action Items  
- Post this as a bounty on ResearchHub  
- Invite redhead users to share their sunscreen experience  
- Cross-reference MC1R mutation and hormonal reactions
