summary: 'A first-of-its-kind effort to track MC1R carriers across time—mapping health constellations and rewriting how redhead biology is studied.'
---


Redheads have been studied for quirks—but never as a lifelong pattern.  
What happens when we track MC1R health outcomes across time, systems, and identity?

### The Scientific Gap  
MC1R affects melanin, pain, neurology, and immune response.  
It’s linked to Parkinson’s, pain sensitivity, and anesthesia risk.  
We are underrepresented in genetic data. No longitudinal study exists for us.

### The Initiative  
Create the first MC1R health cohort.  
Use DeSci tools to map out health constellations—autoimmunity, neurodivergence, migraines, fertility—and generate metadata with informed consent.

### Why It Matters  
We aren’t an anomaly—we’re an overlooked population.  
This project could rewrite assumptions about health, visibility, and long-tail impact.  
It starts with our own data, on our own terms.

### Action Items  
- Launch ‘Join the Study’ page for redhead participants  
- Fund cohort formation via Gitcoin/ResearchHub  
- Tie all other bounties into this longitudinal frame
