summary: 'Exploring a quirky but replicable talent among redheads—finding four-leaf clovers—and what it might tell us about perception and MC1R.'
---


Redheads report a bizarre talent for finding four-leaf clovers.  
Is it visual anomaly detection? Sensory awareness? Luck?  
This quirky trait could open doors to more serious pattern recognition and spatial analysis studies.

### The Hypothesis  
MC1R carriers often show neurological and sensory differences.  
Clover finding is measurable and replicable. No formal research has been done, but anecdotal reports are common.

### The Plan  
We’ll test this in the wild at Redhead Days in Tilburg, track MC1R status, and create a Ranger portal to log and visualize finds.  
We’ll explore correlations with neurodivergence and environmental attention.

### The Opportunity  
This is how a party trick becomes a scientific gateway.  
It’s fun, testable, and could lead to better understanding of MC1R-linked perception.

### Action Items  
- Launch a Ranger portal for field data collection  
- Test it live at Tilburg Redhead Days  
- Feed findings into larger DeSci projects
