        title: "UV radiation and the skin.",
        abstract: "UV radiation (UV) is classified as a \"complete carcinogen\" because it is both a mutagen and a non-specific damaging agent and has properties of both a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter. In environmental abundance, UV is the most important modifiable risk factor for skin cancer and many other environmentally-influenced skin disorders. However, UV also benefits human health by mediating natural synthesis of vitamin D and endorphins in the skin, therefore UV has complex and mixed effects on human health. Nonetheless, excessive exposure to UV carries profound health risks, including atrophy, pigmentary changes, wrinkling and malignancy. UV is epidemiologically and molecularly linked to the three most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, which together affect more than a million Americans annually. Genetic factors also influence risk of UV-mediated skin disease. Polymorphisms of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene, in particular, correlate with fairness of skin, UV sensitivity, and enhanced cancer risk. We are interested in developing UV-protective approaches based on a detailed understanding of molecular events that occur after UV exposure, focusing particularly on epidermal melanization and the role of the MC1R in genome maintenance.",

        abstract: "Nearly 15% of melanomas occur in patients with a family history and a subset of these patients have a germline mutation in a melanoma predisposing gene. CDKN2A mutations are responsible for the majority of hereditary melanoma, but many other susceptibility genes have been discovered in recent years, including CDK4, TERT, ACD, TERF2IP, POT1, MITF, MC1R, and BAP1. Additionally, melanoma risk is increased in mixed cancer syndromes caused by mutations in PTEN, BRCA2, BRCA1, RB1, and TP53. While early onset, multiple tumors, and family cancer history remain the most valuable clinical clues for hereditary melanoma, characteristic epithelioid cytology of melanocytic tumors may suggest an underlying BAP1 mutation. Herein, we review the clinical and histopathologic characteristics of melanocytic tumors associated with these germline mutations and discuss the role of genetic counseling.",

        title: "Ultraviolet Radiations: Skin Defense-Damage Mechanism.",
        abstract: "UV-radiations are the invisible part of light spectra having a wavelength between visible rays and X-rays. Based on wavelength, UV rays are subdivided into UV-A (320-400 nm), UV-B (280-320 nm) and UV-C (200-280 nm). Ultraviolet rays can have both harmful and beneficial effects. UV-C has the property of ionization thus acting as a strong mutagen, which can cause immune-mediated disease and cancer in adverse cases. Numbers of genetic factors have been identified in human involved in inducing skin cancer from UV-radiations. Certain heredity diseases have been found susceptible to UV-induced skin cancer. UV radiations activate the cutaneous immune system, which led to an inflammatory response by different mechanisms. The first line of defense mechanism against UV radiation is melanin (an epidermal pigment), and UV absorbing pigment of skin, which dissipate UV radiation as heat. Cell surface death receptor (e.g. Fas) of keratinocytes responds to UV-induced injury and elicits apoptosis to avoid malignant transformation. In addition to the formation of photo-dimers in the genome, UV also can induce mutation by generating ROS and nucleotides are highly susceptible to these free radical injuries. Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) has been known to be implicated in different UV-induced damages such as pigmentation, adaptive tanning, and skin cancer. UV-B induces the formation of pre-vitamin D3 in the epidermal layer of skin. UV-induced tans act as a photoprotection by providing a sun protection factor (SPF) of 3-4 and epidermal hyperplasia. There is a need to prevent the harmful effects and harness the useful effects of UV radiations.",

        title: "Identifying actionable druggable targets for breast cancer: Mendelian randomization and population-based analyses.",
        abstract: "Drug repurposing provides a cost-effective approach to address the need for breast cancer prevention and therapeutics. We aimed to identify actionable druggable targets using Mendelian randomization (MR) and then validate the candidate drugs using population-based analyses. We identified genetic instruments for 1406 actionable targets of approved non-oncological drugs based on gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTL, and pQTL, respectively). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (122,977 cases, 105,974 controls). We further conducted a nested case-control study using data retrieved from Swedish registers to validate the candidate drugs that were identified from MR analyses. We identified six significant MR associations with gene expression levels (TUBB, MDM2, CSK, ULK3, MC1R and KCNN4) and two significant associations with gene methylation levels across 21 CpG islands (RPS23 and MAPT). Results from the nested case-control study showed that the use of raloxifene (targeting MAPT) was associated with 35% reduced breast cancer risk (odds ratio, OR, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.51-0.83). However, usage of estradiol, tolterodine, and nitrofurantoin (also targeting MAPT) was associated with increased breast cancer risk, with adjusted ORs and 95% CI of 1.10 (1.07-1.13), 1.16 (1.09-1.24), and 1.09 (1.05-1.13), respectively. The effect of raloxifene and nitrofurantoin lost significance in further validation analyses using active-comparator and new-user design. This large-scale MR analysis, combined with population-based validation, identified eight druggable target genes for breast cancer and suggested that raloxifene is an effective chemoprevention against breast cancer.

        abstract: "The incidence of cutaneous melanoma continues to increase in pale skinned peoples in Europe and elsewhere. Epidemiological studies identified genetically determined phenotypes such as pale skin, freckles and red hair, and sunburn as risk factors for this cancer. The development of many melanocytic naevi is also genetically determined and a strong melanoma risk phenotype. Not surprisingly then, genome wide association studies have identified pigmentation genes as common risk genes, and to a lesser extent, genes associated with melanocytic naevi. More unexpectedly, genes associated with telomere length have also been identified as risk genes. Higher risk susceptibility genes have been identified, particularly CDKN2A as the most common cause, and very rarely genes such as CDK4, POT1, TERT and other genes in coding for proteins in the shelterin complex are found to be mutated. Familial melanoma genes are associated with an increased number of melanocytic naevi but not invariably and the atypical naevus phenotype is therefore an imperfect marker of gene carrier status. At a somatic level, the most common driver mutation is BRAF, second most common NRAS, third NF1 and increasing numbers of additional rarer mutations are being identified such as in TP53. It is of note that the BRAF and NRAS mutations are not C>T accepted as characteristic of ultraviolet light induced mutations.",

It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the KIT gene. Genetic analyses reveal a consistent genotype-phenotype relationship in piebaldism. However, recently reported cases of piebaldism that are milder or severer than genetically expected indicate that other factors, such as a modifier gene of MC1R, influence skin and hair color. The KIT ligand/KIT that triggers the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway play essential functions in the migration, proliferation, survival, melanogenesis and melanosome transfer of the melanocytes. We summarize current research progress in piebaldism and related disorders.",

These patients are easily recognised and given appropriate attention. What may not be appreciated is that darker-skinned individuals may also carry melanocortin 1 receptor variant alleles and that they can also be at increased risk of melanoma. Considering that melanocortin 1 receptor is crucial for melanocyte proliferation, regulation and differentiation do the naevi of these darker-skinned individuals have specific features that help identify them as carrying one of these melanocortin 1 receptor variants and do melanomas that develop in dark-skinned melanocortin 1 receptor variant carriers have particular characteristics?",

        abstract: "The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) preferentially expressed in melanocytes is best known as a key regulator of the synthesis of epidermal melanin pigments. Its paracrine stimulation by keratinocyte-derived melanocortins also activates DNA repair pathways and antioxidant defenses to build a complex, multifaceted photoprotective response. Many MC1R actions rely on cAMP-dependent activation of two transcription factors, MITF and PGC1α, but pleiotropic MC1R signaling also involves activation of mitogen-activated kinases and AKT. MC1R partners such as β-arrestins, PTEN and the E3 ubiquitin ligase MGRN1 differentially regulate these pathways. The MC1R gene is complex and polymorphic, with frequent variants associated with skin phenotypes and increased cancer risk. We review current knowledge of signaling from canonical MC1R, its splice isoforms and natural polymorphic variants. Recently discovered intracellular targets and partners are also discussed, to highlight the diversity of mechanisms that may contribute to normal and pathological variation of pigmentation and sensitivity to solar radiation-induced damage.

        abstract: "Only 1-2% of people is red-headed but in the Russian Udmurt Republic or United Kingdom they can be met more often. A specific variant of MC1R gene (R allele) is responsible for the red hair. The gene encodes a receptor for melanocortins. These substances stimulate melanocytes to product melanin- a dye of the skin which is transported to keratinocytes. It protects a cellular nucleus from ultraviolet radiation. Melanin has two types: eumelanin which is dark brown or even black and red/orange pheomelanin. The second one is mostly observed in red-headed which is caused by R allele. The DNA damage occurs more easily because of worse protecting ability of pheomelanin. Moreover this allele is connected with inefficient DNA repair. People with R allele have not only flaming red hairstyle but also very fair skin (often with freckles) and blue eyes. Unfortunately this phenotype is more exposed to harmful effects of UV rays. It means that too extensive exposition to solar light leads to sunburn and development of cancerous skin diseases with melanoma as the worst. R allele is a recessive variant of the gene so only in homozygous persons this characteristic phenotype is observed. Nevertheless blond- or auburn-haired carriers of this allele are also more prone to develop carcinomas. The red-headed also differ from the others in sensitivity to anaesthetics, what is shown by increased MAC. On the other hand these persons less often suffer from vitamin D deficiency. The aim of the article is to present facts and myths of red-headed.",

        abstract: "Human pigmentation characteristics play an important role in the effects of sun exposure, skin cancer induction and disease outcomes. Several of the genes most important for this diversity are involved in the regulation and distribution of melanin pigmentation or enzymes involved in melanogenesis itself within the melanocyte cell present in the skin, hair and eyes. The single nucleotide polymorphisms and extended haplotypes within or surrounding these genes have been identified as risk factors for skin cancer, in particular, melanoma. These same polymorphisms have been under selective pressure leading towards lighter pigmentation in Europeans in the last 5,000-20,000 years that have driven the increase in frequency in modern populations. Although pigmentation is a polygenic trait, due to interactive and quantitative gene effects, strong phenotypic associations are readily apparent for these major genes. However, predictive value and utility are increased when considering gene polymorphism interactions. In melanoma, an increased penetrance is found in cases when pigmentation gene risk alleles such as MC1R variants are coincident with mutation of higher-risk melanoma genes including CDKN2A, CDK4 and MITF E318K, demonstrating an interface between the pathways for pigmentation, naevogenesis and melanoma. The clinical phenotypes associated with germline changes in pigmentation and naevogenic genes must be understood by clinicians, and will be of increasing relevance to dermatologists, as genomics is incorporated into the delivery of personalised medicine.",

An increased risk in the development of skin cancers has been associated with the combination of several environmental factors (i.e., ultraviolet exposure) and genetic background, including melanocortin-1 receptor (<i>MC1R</i>) status. In the last few years, advances in the diagnosis of skin cancers provided a great impact on clinical practice. Despite these advances, NMSCs are still the most common malignancy in humans and melanoma still shows a rising incidence and a poor prognosis when diagnosed at an advanced stage. Efforts are required to underlie the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of melanoma and NMSCs, leading to an optimization of the management of affected patients.

        abstract: "Phenotypic traits, such as red hair and freckling, increase melanoma risk by 2- to 3-fold. In addition, approximately 10% of melanomas are caused by inherited germline mutations that increase melanoma risk from 4- to >1000-fold. This review highlights the key genes responsible for inherited melanoma, with an emphasis on when a patient should undergo genetic testing. Many genetic syndromes associated with increased melanoma risk are also associated with an increased risk of other cancers. Identification of these high-risk patients is essential for preventive behavior reinforcement, genetic counseling, and ensuring other required cancer screenings.",

        abstract: "The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a G protein-coupled receptor crucial for the regulation of melanocyte proliferation and function. Upon binding melanocortins, MC1R activates several signaling cascades, notably the cAMP pathway leading to synthesis of photoprotective eumelanin. Polymorphisms in the MC1R gene are a major source of normal variation of human hair color and skin pigmentation, response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), and skin cancer susceptibility. The identification of a surprisingly high number of MC1R natural variants strongly associated with pigmentary phenotypes and increased skin cancer risk has prompted research on the functional properties of the wild-type receptor and frequent mutant alleles. We summarize current knowledge on MC1R structural and functional properties, as well as on its intracellular trafficking and signaling. We also review the current knowledge about the function of MC1R as a skin cancer, particularly melanoma, susceptibility gene and how it modulates the response of melanocytes to UVR.",

        abstract: "Melanocortins mediate their biological functions via five different melanocortin receptors (MC1R - MC5R). MC1R is expressed in the skin and leukocytes, where it regulates skin pigmentation and inflammatory responses. MC1R is also present in the liver and white adipose tissue, but its functional role in these tissues is unclear. This study aimed at determining the regulatory role of MC1R in fatty acid metabolism. Male recessive yellow (Mc1r<sup>e/e</sup>) mice, a model of global MC1R deficiency, and male hepatocyte-specific MC1R deficient mice (Mc1r LKO) were fed a chow or Western diet for 12 weeks. The mouse models were characterized for body weight and composition, liver adiposity, adipose tissue mass and morphology, glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, qPCR and RNA sequencing analyses were used to investigate gene expression profiles in the liver and adipose tissue. HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes were used to study the effects of pharmacological MC1R activation. Chow- and Western diet-fed Mc1r<sup>e/e</sup> showed increased liver weight, white adipose tissue mass and plasma triglyceride (TG) concentration compared to wild type mice. This phenotype occurred without significant changes in food intake, body weight, physical activity or glucose metabolism. Mc1r LKO mice displayed a similar phenotype characterized by larger fat depots, increased adipocyte hypertrophy and enhanced accumulation of TG in the liver and plasma. In terms of gene expression, markers of de novo lipogenesis, inflammation and apoptosis were upregulated in the liver of Mc1r LKO mice, while enzymes regulating lipolysis were downregulated in white adipose tissue of these mice. In cultured hepatocytes, selective activation of MC1R reduced ChREBP expression, which is a central transcription factor for lipogenesis. Hepatocyte-specific loss of MC1R disturbs fatty acid metabolism in the liver and leads to an obesity phenotype characterized by enhanced adipocyte hypertrophy and TG accumulation in the liver and circulation.",

Immunosuppressive drugs combined with traditional risk factors such as UV radiation exposure are the main modifiable risk factors for skin cancer development in transplant recipients. Genetic variation affecting immunosuppressive drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has been associated with other transplant complications and may contribute to differences in skin cancer rates between KTRs. Genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding the prednisolone receptor, GST enzyme, MC1R, MTHFR enzyme and COX-2 enzyme have been shown to increase the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in KTRs. Genetic association studies may improve our understanding of how genetic variation affects skin cancer risk and potentially guide immunosuppressive treatment and skin cancer screening in at risk individuals.",

        abstract: "Moving beyond numeric representations of risk perceptions, we examine cognitive causation, or superstitious thinking, and negative affect in risk as predictors of <i>MC1R</i> (i.e., moderate v. high risk) skin cancer genetic testing and responses to this testing. Participants (<i>N</i> = 496) completed baseline assessments using validated measures of cognitive causation (beliefs that thinking about cancer risk increases cancer likelihood) and negative affect in risk (negative feelings generated during risk perception) and subsequently received a test offer. Participants could access a website to learn about and request genetic testing.

Those with higher negative affect in risk were less likely to return a saliva sample for testing (odds ratio = 0.98, 95% confidence interval = 0.96-0.99). Those with higher cognitive causation reported more fear (<i>b</i> = 0.28-0.31; <i>P</i>'s < 0.05). Higher negative affect in risk was associated with more emotion-laden test responses, particularly in those receiving higher-risk as compared with average-risk results.

        abstract: "Melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, results from the malignant transformation of melanocytes located in the basement membrane separating the epidermal and dermal skin compartments. Cutaneous melanoma is often initiated by solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced mutations. Melanocytes intimately interact with keratinocytes, which provide growth factors and melanocortin peptides acting as paracrine regulators of proliferation and differentiation. Keratinocyte-derived melanocortins activate melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) to protect melanocytes from the carcinogenic effect of UVR. Accordingly, MC1R is a major determinant of susceptibility to melanoma. Despite extensive phenotypic heterogeneity and high mutation loads, the molecular basis of melanomagenesis and the molecules mediating the crosstalk between melanoma and stromal cells are relatively well understood. Mutations of intracellular effectors of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling, notably NRAS and BRAF, are major driver events more frequent than mutations in RTKs. Nevertheless, melanomas often display aberrant signalling from RTKs such as KIT, ERRB1-4, FGFR, MET and PDGFR, which contribute to disease progression and resistance to targeted therapies. Progress has also been made to unravel the role of the tumour secretome in preparing the metastatic niche. However, key aspects of the melanoma-stroma interplay, such as the molecular determinants of dormancy, remain poorly understood.",

        abstract: "Malignant melanoma of the skin is the leading cause of death from skin cancer and ranks fifth in cancer incidence among all cancers in the United States. While melanoma mortality has remained steady for the past several decades, melanoma incidence has been increasing, particularly among fair-skinned individuals. According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 10,000 people in the United States will die from melanoma this year. Individuals with dark skin complexion are protected damage generated by UV-light due to the high content of UV-blocking melanin pigment in their epidermis as well as better capacity for melanocytes to cope with UV damage. There is now ample evidence that suggests that the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a major melanoma risk factor. Inherited loss-of-function mutations in MC1R are common in melanoma-prone persons, correlating with a less melanized skin complexion and poorer recovery from mutagenic photodamage. We and others are interested in the MC1R signaling pathway in melanocytes, its mechanisms of enhancing genomic stability and pharmacologic opportunities to reduce melanoma risk based on those insights. In this chapter, we review melanoma risk factors, the MC1R signaling pathway, and the relationship between MC1R signaling and DNA repair.",

        abstract: "Although human pigmentation is genetically complex, to date polymorphism at only 1 locus, the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R), has been associated with physiologic variation in hair and skin color. The MC1-R, a G protein-coupled receptor with 7 transmembrane-spanning domains, plays a key role in determining the type of melanin (eumelanin vs pheomelanin) that is produced within melanocytes. This article begins with an overview of melanocortin receptors, proopiomelanocortin-derived ligands, and the agouti antagonist, with particular focus on their functions in regulating eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesis, including UV-induced melanogenesis. A brief description of mouse-coat-color genetics is then followed by a discussion of human MC1-R variants, which are present in approximately 50% of white populations. We review the increasing evidence that loss-of-function MC1-R mutations largely account for the red hair phenotype in humans (which approximates an autosomal recessive trait) and also have a strong association with fair skin and a decreased ability to tan, with a significant heterozygote effect in individuals without red hair. Finally, we examine recent work showing that loss-of-function MC1-R variants may increase the risk of developing melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer beyond their effects on pigmentation phenotype.",

        abstract: "The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene encodes for a seven-pass transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on melanocytes and melanoma cells. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, also termed variants) in MC1R frequently cause red hair, fair skin and are associated with melanoma and keratinocyte-derived skin cancer development. Activation of wild-type (WT) MC1R in skin assists cutaneous photoprotection whereas reduced MC1R signalling, seen with MC1R variants, impairs ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-protective responses. As ancestral humans migrated out of Africa, the evolutionary advantage of MC1R variants may have related to improved cutaneous vitamin D synthesis and higher birthweight reported with certain MC1R variants. Reduced photoprotection secondary to MC1R dysfunction involves pigmentary and non-pigmentary mechanisms (reduced DNA repair, effects on cell proliferation and possibly immunological parameters), leading to clonal expansion of mutated cells within skin and subsequent carcinogenesis. Recent investigations suggest an association between MC1R genotype and vitiligo, with preliminary evidence that a MC1R agonist, [Nle4-D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH, in combination with UVB, assists repigmentation. Future development of compounds to correct defective MC1R responses secondary to MC1R variants could result in photoprotective benefits for fair-skinned individuals and reduce their skin cancer risk.",

        abstract: "Epidemiological studies suggest a link between the melanoma-related pigmentation gene melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). We previously showed that MC1R signaling can facilitate nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron survival. The present study investigates the neuroprotective potential of MC1R against neurotoxicity induced by alpha-synuclein (αSyn), a key player in PD genetics and pathogenesis. Nigral dopaminergic neuron toxicity induced by local overexpression of aSyn was assessed in mice that have an inactivating mutation of MC1R, overexpress its wild-type transgene, or were treated with MC1R agonists. The role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in MC1R-mediated protection against αSyn was characterized in vitro. Furthermore, MC1R expression was determined in human postmortem midbrain from patients with PD and unaffected subjects. Targeted expression of αSyn in the nigrostriatal pathway induced exacerbated synuclein pathologies in MC1R mutant mice, which were accompanied by neuroinflammation and altered Nrf2 responses, and reversed by the human MC1R transgene. Two MC1R agonists were neuroprotective against αSyn-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. In vitro experiments showed that Nrf2 was a necessary mediator of MC1R effects. Lastly, MC1R was present in dopaminergic neurons in the human substantia nigra and appeared to be reduced at the tissue level in PD patients. Our study supports an interaction between MC1R and αSyn that can be mediated by neuronal MC1R possibly through Nrf2. It provides evidence for MC1R as a therapeutic target and a rationale for development of MC1R-activating strategies for PD.",

        abstract: "We have examined melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) variant allele frequencies in the general population and in a collection of adolescent dizygotic and monozygotic twins to determine statistical associations of pigmentation phenotypes with increased skin cancer risk. This included hair and skin color, freckling, mole count and sun exposed skin reflectance. Nine variants were studied and designated as either strong R (OR = 63; 95% CI 32-140) or weak r (OR = 5; 95% CI 3-11) red hair alleles. Penetrance of each MC1R variant allele was consistent with an allelic model where effects were multiplicative for red hair but additive for skin reflectance. To assess the interaction of the brown eye color gene BEY2/OCA2 on the phenotypic effects of variant MC1R alleles we imputed OCA2 genotype in the twin collection. A modifying effect of OCA2 on MC1R variant alleles was seen on constitutive skin color, freckling and mole count. In order to study the individual effects of these variants on pigmentation phenotype we have established a series of human primary melanocyte strains genotyped for the MC1R receptor. These include strains which are MC1R wild-type consensus, variant heterozygotes, and homozygotes for strong R alleles Arg151Cys and Arg160Trp. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that only consensus strains contained stage III and IV melanosomes in their terminal dendrites whereas Arg151Cys and Arg160Trp homozygous strains contained only immature stage I and II melanosomes. Such genetic association studies combined with the functional analysis of MC1R variant alleles in melanocytic cells should provide a link in understanding the association between pigmentary phototypes and skin cancer risk.",

        abstract: "In the animal kingdom, skin pigmentation is highly variable between species, and it contributes to phenotypes. In humans, skin pigmentation plays a part in sun protection. Skin pigmentation depends on the ratio of the two pigments pheomelanin and eumelanin, both synthesized by a specialized cell population, the melanocytes. In this review, we explore one important factor in pigmentation: the tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) gene which is involved in eumelanin synthesis via the TYRP1 protein. Counterintuitively, high TYRP1 mRNA expression is associated with a poor clinical outcome for patients with metastatic melanomas. Recently, we were able to explain this unexpected TYRP1 function by demonstrating that TYRP1 mRNA sequesters microRNA-16, a tumor suppressor miRNA. Here, we focus on actors influencing TYRP1 mRNA abundance, particularly transcription factors, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and miRNAs, as they all dictate the indirect oncogenic activity of TYRP1.",

        abstract: "MC1R polymorphisms have been reported to be under a selective constraint in populations inhabiting high UVR regions such as Africans; however, these patterns are not consistent. Here we analyze the MC1R gene in West Maharashtra, India to see if sequence diversity corresponds to their diverse pigmentary profiles and if MC1R is constrained in dark skinned tribal as compared to lighter skinned caste populations. A 2648 bp region of this gene was sequenced in 102 individuals and the data was compared for π, ϴ diversity indices. Tajima's D was assessed for signatures of purifying selection and MC1R variants were associated with MI measures using the additive, dominant, and recessive models. Pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> was tested among study populations and between study populations and 1000 Genomes regional samples. MC1R diversity was not uniquely patterned among castes and tribes. Non-synonymous variants rs2228479A, rs1805007_T, and rs885479_A showed low variability in these populations. Selection tests did not indicate any constraint on MC1R and pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> were also low among the study populations (-0.0163 to 0.06112). The SNP rs3212359 was significantly associated with MI measures when tested using different association models. We do not find evidence of a selective constraint on MC1R. The presence of a large number of unique haplotypes and low F<sub>ST</sub> values at this locus suggests that MC1R polymorphisms may not be influencing pigmentation variation among castes and tribes in this region. Observed associations between rs3212359 and MI measures need to be validated through studies on larger samples and in-vitro functional studies.",

However, this gene might also play an important role in shaping pigmentation of other human populations, where it experiences different selective pressures.

        abstract: "Melanins are widely distributed in animals and plants; in vertebrates, most melanins are present on the body surface. The diversity of pigmentation in vertebrates is mainly attributed to the quantity and ratio of eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesis. Most natural melanin pigments in animals consist of both eumelanin and pheomelanin in varying ratios, and thus, their combined synthesis is called \"mixed melanogenesis.\" Gene expression is an established mechanism for controlling melanin synthesis; however, there are multiple factors that affect melanin synthesis besides gene expression. Due to the differential sensitivity of the eumelanin and pheomelanin synthetic pathways to pH, melanosomal pH likely plays a major role in mixed melanogenesis. Here, we focused on various factors affecting mixed melanogenesis including (1) chemical regulation of melanin synthesis, (2) melanosomal pH regulation during normal melanogenesis and effect on mixed melanogenesis, and (3) mechanisms of melanosomal pH control (proton pumps, channels, transporters, and signaling pathways).",

Fair skin and red hair are characterized by a low eumelanin to pheomelanin ratio, and have been associated with increased risk of skin cancer. Cutaneous pigmentation is a complex genetic trait, with more than 120 genes involved in its regulation, among which the melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R) plays a key role. Although a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in pigmentation genes, very few SNPs have been examined in relation to human pigmentary phenotypes and skin cancer risk. Recent GWAS have identified new candidate determinants of pigmentation traits, but MC1R remains the best characterized genetic determinant of human skin and hair pigmentation as well as the more firmly validated low-penetrance skin cancer susceptibility gene. In this review, we will address how the melanocortin system regulates pigmentation, the effect of MC1R variants on the physiologic function of the MC1 receptor, and how specific MC1R variants are associated with distinct human pigmentation phenotypes.",

        abstract: "The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic among lightly pigmented populations, and several variants in the MC1R gene have been associated with increased risk of both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers. The functional consequences of MC1R gene variants have been studied in vitro and in vivo in postulated causal pathways, such as G-protein-coupled signaling transduction, pigmentation, immune response, inflammatory response, cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix adhesion. In a case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study, we utilized hierarchical modeling approaches, incorporating quantitative information from these functional studies, to examine the association between particular MC1R alleles and the risk of skin cancers. Different prior matrices were constructed according to the phenotypic associations in controls, cell surface expression, and enzymatic kinetics. Our results showed the parameter variance estimates of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were smaller when using a hierarchical modeling approach compared to standard multivariable regression. Estimates of second-level parameters gave information about the relative importance of MC1R effects on different pathways, and odds ratio estimates changed depending on prior models (e.g., the change ranged from -21% to 7% for melanoma risk assessment). In addition, the estimates of prior model hyperparameters in the hierarchical modeling approach allow us to determine the relevance of individual pathways on the risk of each of the skin cancer types. In conclusion, hierarchical modeling provides a useful analytic approach in addition to the widely used conventional models in genetic association studies that can incorporate measures of allelic function.",

        abstract: "The melanocortin receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors, which are essential components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and they mediate the actions of melanocortins (melanocyte-stimulating hormones: α-MSH, β-MSH, and γ-MSH) as well as the adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) in skin pigmentation, adrenal steroidogenesis, and stress response. Three melanocortin receptor genes (<i>MC1R</i>, <i>MC2R</i>, and <i>MC5R</i>) contribute to the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD), and one melanocortin receptor gene (<i>MC4R</i>) contributes to the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). MDD increases T2D risk in drug-naïve patients; thus, MDD and T2D commonly coexist. The five melanocortin receptor genes might confer risk for both disorders. However, they have never been investigated jointly to evaluate their potential contributing roles in the MDD-T2D comorbidity, specifically within families. In 212 Italian families with T2D and MDD, we tested 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <i>MC1R</i> gene, 9 SNPs in <i>MC2R</i>, 3 SNPs in <i>MC3R</i>, 4 SNPs in <i>MC4R</i>, and 2 SNPs in <i>MC5R</i>. The testing used 2-point parametric linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD) (i.e., association) analysis with four models (dominant with complete penetrance (D1), dominant with incomplete penetrance (D2), recessive with complete penetrance (R1), and recessive with incomplete penetrance (R2)). We detected significant (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) linkage and/or LD (i.e., association) to/with MDD for one SNP in <i>MC2R</i> (rs111734014) and one SNP in <i>MC5R</i> (rs2236700), and to/with T2D for three SNPs in <i>MC1R</i> (rs1805007 and rs201192930, and rs2228479), one SNP in <i>MC2R</i> (rs104894660), two SNPs in <i>MC3R</i> (rs3746619 and rs3827103), and one SNP in <i>MC4R</i> genes (Chr18-60372302). The linkage/LD/association was significant across different linkage patterns and different modes of inheritance. All reported variants are novel in MDD and T2D. This is the first study to report risk variants in <i>MC1R</i>, <i>MC2R</i>, and <i>MC3R</i> genes in T2D. <i>MC2R</i> and <i>MC5R</i> genes are replicated in MDD, with one novel variant each. Within our dataset, only the <i>MC2R</i> gene appears to confer risk for both MDD and T2D, albeit with different risk variants. To further clarity the role of the melanocortin receptor genes in MDD-T2D, these findings should be sought among other ethnicities as well.",

        abstract: "Pigmentary traits such as red hair, fair skin, lack of tanning ability and propensity to freckle (the RHC phenotype) have been identified as genetic risk factors for both melanoma and non-melanocytic skin cancers when combined with the environmental risk factor of high ultraviolet light exposure. The human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is a key determinant of the pigmentation process and can account in large part for the diverse range of variation in human pigmentation phenotypes and skin phototypes. The coding sequence is highly polymorphic in human populations, with several of these variant forms of the receptor now known to be associated with the RHC phenotype. We have examined variant allele frequencies in the general population and in a collection of adolescent dizygotic and monozygotic twins with defined pigmentation characteristics. Variant allele frequencies have also been determined in several case-control studies of sporadic melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and in familial melanoma kindreds collected within Australia. These studies have shown that three RHC alleles - Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp and Asp294His - were associated with increased risk in all forms of skin cancer and with penetrance and age of onset in familial melanoma in mutation carriers. There is a significant RHC allele heterozygote carrier effect on skin phototype and skin cancer risk, which indicates that variant alleles do not behave in a strictly recessive manner. Ultimately, the genetic and chemical assessment of melanin synthesis rather than skin colour will be the best indicator for skin cancer risk, and such genetic association studies combined with functional analysis of variant alleles should provide the link to understanding skin phototypes.",

With the advent of a catalogue of millions of potential DNA polymorphisms, attention is now also being focused on identification of genes that confer a more modest contribution to melanoma risk, such as those encoding proteins involved in pigmentation, DNA repair, cell growth and differentiation or detoxification of metabolites. One such pigmentation gene, MC1R, has not only been found to be a low penetrance melanoma gene but has also been shown to act as a genetic modifier of melanoma risk in individuals carrying CDKN2A mutations. Most recently, an environmental agent, ultraviolet radiation, has also been established as a modifier of melanoma risk in CDKN2A mutation carriers. Hence, melanoma is turning out to be an excellent paradigm for studying gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.",

Red hair in man is due to certain loss of function mutations of one of the peptide products of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R, MIM 155555). Such functional mutations enable the melanocyte to produce red-yellow pheomelanin in preference to the default, black-brown eumelanin.

        title: "Genetic mutations that prevent pain: implications for future pain medication.",
        abstract: "Part of the interindividual variability in pain therapy has been associated with genetic polymorphisms. Several genetic variants prevent or at least decrease pain in their carriers as compared with carriers of the respective wild-type or common alleles by impeding the generation, transmission and processing of nociceptive information or by increasing the local availability of active analgesics or their pharmacodynamic effects. Complete prevention of pain has so far been seen in six distinct rare hereditary syndromes, namely the 'channelopathy-associated insensitivity to pain', caused by 13 currently identified variants in the SCN9A gene coding for the alpha-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, and five maladies belonging to the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) I-V syndromes, caused by various mutations in several genes. Reduced pain in the average population has been associated with frequent variants in the micro-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT), guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1/dopa-responsive dystonia gene (GCH1), transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 gene (TRPV1) or the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R). Duplications/amplifications of the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene leading to increased enzyme function may cause intense opioid effects of codeine up to toxicity. The COMT V158M variant has been associated with decreased morphine requirements for analgesia. Inactivating MC1R variants have been associated with increased opioid analgesia of the micro-opioid receptor agonist morphine-6-glucuronide and, in women only, of kappa-opioid agonists. Finally, variants in the P-glycoprotein gene (ABCB1) conferring decreased transporter function have been associated with increased respiratory depressive effects of fentanyl. In summary, a finite number of genetic variants that prevent pain by decreasing nociception or increasing analgesia have been identified. Given the complex biological and psychological nature of pain, we will see in the near future how much of the interindividual variance in pain and analgesia is due to identifiable genetic causes, and to what extent genetics enters clinical pain therapy.",

        title: "Identification and validation of prognosis-associated DNA repair gene signatures in colorectal cancer.",
        abstract: "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignant tumor. DNA damage plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis, and abnormal DNA repair pathways affect the occurrence and progression of CRC. In the current study, we aimed to construct a DNA repair-related gene (DRG) signature to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with CRC patients. The differentially expressed DRGs (DE-DRGs) were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The prognostic gene signature was identified by univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier curves and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the underlying biological processes and signaling pathways. ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT were implemented to estimate the tumor immune score and immune cell infiltration status between the different risk group. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was evaluated to representing the drug response of this signature. Nine DE-DRGs (ESCO2, AXIN2, PLK1, CDC25C, IGF1, TREX2, ALKBH2, ESR1 and MC1R) signatures was constructed to classify patients into high- and low-risk groups. The risk score was an independent prognostic indicator of OS (hazard ratio > 1, P < 0.001). The genetic alteration analysis indicated that the nine DE-DRGs in the signature were changed in 63 required samples (100%), and the major alteration was missense mutation. Function enrichment analysis revealed that the immune response and mtotic sister chromatid segregation were the main biological processes. The high-risk group had higher immune score than the low-risk group. What's more, low-risk patients were more sensitive to selumetinib and dasatinib. The nine DE-DRGs signature was significantly associated with OS and provided a new insight for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC.",

        title: "A review of the role of genetic testing in pain medicine.",
        abstract: "Pain clinicians have always been challenged by the variability of response to pain treatment. Differences in the degree of pain stimulation and pain sensitivity, weight and age differences, prior opioid use and tolerance, as well as the differences in bioavailability of various opioid formulations have been cited as causes for the wide variability in analgesia seen with opioids. Genetics may explain the variability of responses and help to predict more effective (or less dangerous) medication choices and doses. Genetics may also help to predict the response to specific opioids and antidepressants. In this review article, we discuss the genetic influence of nociception, analgesia, and hyoanalgesia. The CYP450 enzymes involved in the metabolism and activity of opioids and adjuvant analgesics are genetically controlled, as are the opioid receptors and a variety of brain chemistries. This article discusses the specific pain implications of genetic variations in CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP3A7, OPRM1, OPRK1, OPRD1, COMT, GABA, UGT, MC1R, GCH1, ABCB1, P-glycoprotein, 5HTR1A, 5HTR2A, MTHFR, CACNA2D2, and 5-HTTLPR. Recent research findings suggest the relationship between genetic predisposition and clinical behavior, including the risk of opioid misuse and addiction. While urine drug testing may hint at genetic issues regarding opioid metabolism, cheek swab DNA testing has become economically viable, and we review the current and future genetic pain issues that may influence the decisions that pain clinicians make every day. Genetic testing may explain and predict many of the clinical responses seen with opioids and adjuvant medications, and may help the clinician identify those patients at genetic risk of opioid misuse and addiction.",

        abstract: "Tietz albinism-deafness syndrome (TADS) is a rare and severe manifestation of Waardenburg syndrome that is primarily linked to mutations in MITF. In this report, we present a case of TADS resulting from a novel c.637G>C mutation in MITF (p.Glu213Gln; GenBank Accession number: NM_000248). A 3-year-old girl presented with congenital generalized hypopigmentation of the hair, skin, and irides along with complete sensorineural hearing loss. Histopathological and electron microscopy investigations indicated that this variant did not alter the number of melanocytes in the skin but significantly impaired melanosome maturation within melanocytes. Comprehensive melanin analysis revealed marked reductions in both eumelanin (EM) and pheomelanin (PM) rather than changes in the EM-to-PM ratio observed in oculocutaneous albinism. We conducted an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to investigate the binding capability of the identified variant to DNA sequences containing the E-box motif along with other known variants (p.Arg217del and p.Glu213Asp). Remarkably, all three variants exhibited dominant-negative effects, thus providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of TADS. This study sheds light on the genetic mechanisms underlying TADS and offers a deeper understanding of this rare condition and its associated mutations in MITF.",

MC1R activation after ultraviolet radiation exposure results in the production of the dark eumelanin pigment and the tanning process in humans, providing physical protection against DNA damage. The MC1R gene is highly polymorphic in Caucasian populations with a number of MC1R variant alleles associated with red hair, fair skin, freckling, poor tanning, and increased risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. Variant receptors have shown alterations in biochemical function, largely due to intracellular retention or impaired G-protein coupling, but retain some signaling ability. The association of MC1R variant alleles with skin cancer risk remains after correction for pigmentation phenotype, indicating regulation of nonpigmentary pathways. Notably, MC1R activation has been linked to DNA repair and may also contribute to the regulation of immune responses.",

        abstract: "The melanocortin MC(1) receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor expressed in the melanocytes of the skin and hair and is known for its key role in the regulation of human pigmentation. Melanocortin MC(1) receptor activation after ultraviolet radiation exposure results in a switch from the red/yellow pheomelanin to the brown/black eumelanin pigment synthesis within cutaneous melanocytes; this pigment is then transferred to the surrounding keratinocytes of the skin. The increase in melanin maturation and uptake results in tanning of the skin, providing a physical protection of skin cells from ultraviolet radiation induced DNA damage. Melanocortin MC(1) receptor polymorphism is widespread within the Caucasian population and some variant alleles are associated with red hair colour, fair skin, poor tanning and increased risk of skin cancer. Here we will discuss the use of mouse coat colour models, human genetic association studies, and in vitro cell culture studies to determine the complex functions of the melanocortin MC(1) receptor and the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between melanocortin MC(1) receptor variant alleles and the red hair colour phenotype. Recent research indicates that melanocortin MC(1) receptor has many non-pigmentary functions, and that the increased risk of skin cancer conferred by melanocortin MC(1) receptor variant alleles is to some extent independent of pigmentation phenotypes. The use of new transgenic mouse models, the study of novel melanocortin MC(1) receptor response genes and the use of more advanced human skin models such as 3D skin reconstruction may provide key elements in understanding the pharmacogenetics of human melanocortin MC(1) receptor polymorphism.",

        abstract: "Coat color, as a distinct phenotypic characteristic of pigs, is often subject to preference and selection, such as in the breeding process of new breed. Shanxia long black pig was derived from an intercross between Berkshire boars and Licha black pig sows, and it was bred as a paternal strain with high-quality meat and black coat color. Although the coat color was black in the F<sub>1</sub> generation of the intercross, it segregated in the subsequent generations. This study aims to decode the genetic basis of coat color segregation and develop a method to distinct black pigs from the spotted in Shanxia long black pig. Only a QTL was mapped at the proximal end of chromosome 6, and MC1R gene was picked out as functional candidate gene. A total of 11 polymorphic loci were identified in MC1R gene, and only the c.67_68insCC variant was co-segregating with coat color. This locus isn't recognized by any restriction endonuclease, so it can't be genotyped by PCR-RFLP. The c.370G > A polymorphic locus was also significantly associated with coat color, and has been in tightly linkage disequilibrium with the c.67_68insCC. Furthermore, it is recognized by BspHI. Therefore, a PCR-RFLP method was set up to genotype this locus. Besides the 175 sequenced individuals, another more 1,391 pigs were genotyped with PCR-RFLP, and all of pigs with GG (one band) were black. MC1R gene (c.67_68insCC) is the causative gene (mutation) for the coat color segregation, and the PCR-RFLP of c.370G > A could be used in the breeding program of Shanxia long black pig.",

We performed genome-wide association studies on the PSQ score (25,321 participants) and CPT duration (6853). We identified one new genome-wide significant locus associated with the PSQ score, which was located in the TSSC1 (also known as EIPR1 ) gene (rs58194899, OR = 0.950 [0.933-0.967], P -value = 1.9 × 10 -8 ). Although high pain sensitivity measured by both PSQ and CPT was associated with individual history of chronic and acute pains, genetic correlation analyses surprisingly suggested an opposite direction: PSQ score was inversely genetically correlated with neck and shoulder pain ( rg = -0.71), rheumatoid arthritis (-0.68), and osteoarthritis (-0.38), and with known risk factors, such as the length of working week (-0.65), smoking (-0.36), or extreme BMI (-0.23). Gene-based analysis followed by pathway analysis showed that genome-wide association studies results were enriched for genes expressed in the brain and involved in neuronal development and glutamatergic synapse signaling pathways. Finally, we confirmed that females with red hair were more sensitive to pain and found that genetic variation in the MC1R gene was associated with an increase in self-perceived pain sensitivity as assessed by the PSQ.",

We addressed the occurrence of MITF-E318K and its association with germline status of CDKN2A and MC1R genes in a hospital-based series of 248 melanoma patients including cohorts of multiple, familial, pediatric, sporadic and melanoma associated with other tumors. Seven MITF-E318K carriers were identified, spanning every group except the pediatric patients. Three carriers showed mutated CDKN2A, five displayed MC1R variants, while the sporadic carrier revealed no variants. Germline/tumor whole exome sequencing for this carrier revealed germline variants of unknown significance in ATM and FANCI genes and, in four BRAF-V600E metastases, somatic loss of the MITF wild-type allele, amplification of MITF-E318K and deletion of a 9p21.3 chromosomal region including CDKN2A and MTAP. <i>In silico</i> analysis of tumors from MITF-E318K melanoma carriers in the TCGA Pan-Cancer-Atlas dataset confirmed the association with BRAF mutation and 9p21.3 deletion revealing a common genetic pattern. MTAP was the gene deleted at homozygous level in the highest number of patients.

Evaluating SNPs in <i>MC1R</i> and association with race/ethnicity, skin type, and perceived cancer risk in a New Mexico (NM) population will elucidate the role of <i>MC1R</i> in a multicultural population. We genotyped <i>MC1R</i> in 191 NMs attending a primary care clinic in Albuquerque. We obtained individuals' self-identified race/ethnicity, skin type, and perceived cancer risk. We defined genetic risk as carriage of any one or more of the nine most common SNPs in <i>MC1R</i>. We found that one <i>MC1R</i> SNP, R163Q (rs885479), was identified in 47.6% of self-identified Hispanics and 12.9% of non-Hispanic whites (NHW), making Hispanics at higher \"genetic risk\" (as defined by carrying one of the <i>MC1R</i> common variants). When we deleted R163Q from analyses, Hispanics were no longer at higher genetic risk (33.3%) compared with NHW (48.3%), consistent with melanoma rates, tanning ability, and lower perceived risk. Hispanics had a perceived risk significantly lower than NHW and a nonsignificant better tanning ability than NHW. The R163Q variant in <i>MC1R</i> may not be a risk factor for melanoma among NM Hispanics. This suggestion points to the need to carefully interpret genetic risk factors among specific populations. Genetic risk cannot be extrapolated from Northern European populations directly to non-European populations.",

        abstract: "MC1R (melanocortin 1 receptor) encodes the melanocortin-1 receptor, which can activate intracellular cAMP synthesis under the stimulation of the α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) ligand. Increased cAMP then activates the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, resulting in the up-regulation of the expression of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) which is a critical regulatory factor of melanin synthesis, and tyrosinase (TYR), the rate-limiting enzyme of melanin synthesis tyrosinase (TYR), and ultimately affects production of eumelanin and pheomelanin, and the coat color phenotype of mammalian species. Previous reports have indicated that the mutation A243T in the transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) of MC1R protein might disrupt the function of MC1R, contributing to the red phenotype in Duroc pig. However, functional analysis of the A243T mutation in MC1R has not yet been carried out. In this study, we attempted to used single-stranded oligo-deoxyribonucleotides (ssODN) as donor templates to introduce the c.727G>A (A243T) mutation into MC1R in human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-2 by CRISPR/Cas9 to analyze its effects on MC1R functions. We found the occurrence of ssODN recombination reached to 10%. Unfortunately, Sanger sequencing MC1R in six single-cell clones revealed that none carried the c.727G>A mutation, but all carried undesired mutations surrounding the target site. Cells transfected with CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids and ssODN presented significantly attenuated cAMP activation, and down-regulated MITF and TYR expression, indicating that the editing MC1R could affect the melanin synthesis function in cells. This study provides a basis for further investigation the mechanism of MC1R mutation on animal coat color.",

        abstract: "Binding of melanocortin peptide agonists to the melanocortin-1 receptor of melanocytes results in eumelanin production, whereas binding of the agouti signalling protein inverse agonist results in pheomelanin synthesis. Recently, a novel melanocortin-1 receptor ligand was reported. A β-defensin gene mutation was found to be responsible for black coat colour in domestic dogs. Notably, the human equivalent, β-defensin 3, was found to bind with high affinity to the melanocortin-1 receptor; however, the action of β-defensin as an agonist or antagonist was unknown. Here, we use in vitro assays to show that β-defensin 3 is able to act as a weak partial agonist for cAMP signalling in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing human melanocortin-1 receptor. β-defensin 3 is also able to activate MAPK signalling in HEK cells stably expressing either wild type or variant melanocortin-1 receptors. We suggest that β-defensin 3 may be a novel melanocortin-1 receptor agonist involved in regulating melanocyte responses in humans.",

        abstract: "Background: Studies have identified numerous genetic polymorphisms associated with increased risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). In this pilot study, we aimed to examine whether previously identified melanoma and non-melanoma associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which were found to be associated with cutaneous malignancy were also present in a relatively heterogeneous population with a history of skin cancer versus an age and environmental matched controls. The undertaking of this project serves to further the current understanding of the genetic profile for those at higher risk for developing skin cancer. Methods: Nineteen NMSC patients and their age-matched and environmental controls underwent genotyping of 7 previously discovered SNPs associated with melanoma and NMSC. Results: In a random, heterogeneous population in Southern California, SNP’s Chr1, PAD16, PIGU, TDG had a similar association with NMSC previously reported in prior studies. Due to small trial size, no conclusions or observable associations could be drawn from the SNPs MC1R, TP53, and XRCC1. Conclusion: This data supports that 4 of the 7 SNP’s studied had similar associations and could potentially be predictive tool of NMSC risk in this patient population. The remaining three SNP’s did not have a definitive association with malignancy. Larger studies are needed to further elucidate the specific roles of these SNPs collectively and ultimately to develop a genetic profile for those patients at increased risk of developing skin cancer.

        abstract: "Variants in the Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) gene have been associated with an increased risk of melanoma, but the role in nevus count is unclear. We investigated if specific MC1R gene variants or the number of MC1R gene variants and phenotypical features were associated with nevus count. A total of 494 participants of the 'Leiden skin cancer study' were included and the MC1R gene coding sequence was analysed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by sequencing of unknown variants. The association between MC1R gene variants and nevus count and the association between age, gender and phenotypical features and nevus count were studied using the Chi-square test. Study of nine frequently occurring MC1R gene variants in participants without skin cancer (n = 203) showed that the 'r' Val60Leu variant was significantly associated with high nevus count (>50 nevi) (P = 0.017). This association was very strong among women (P < 0.001), but not present among men. Having one or two MC1R variants in general did not show a significant difference in the nevus count. Hair colour, skin type, eye colour and age were not significantly associated with nevus count, whereas gender showed a significant association (P = 0.008), with the highest nevus counts in female. The Val60Leu variant of the MC1R gene could be a promising candidate as an independent predictor of high nevus count, particularly in women. This information about the genetic makeup could promote personalized follow-up strategies and might help to prevent skin cancer in the future.",

        abstract: "The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is one of the key proteins involved in the regulation of melanin production and several polymorphisms have been associated with different phenotypes of skin and hair color in human and nonhuman species. Most of the knowledge is centered on more homogeneous populations and studies involving an admixed group of people should be encouraged due to the great importance of understanding the human color variation. This work evaluates the MC1R diversity and the possible impacts of MC1R variants in an admixed sample population of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which is a product of Native American, African, and European miscegenation. Sequencing of complete coding region and part of the 3´UTR of MC1R gene identified 31 variants including one insertion and three novel synonymous substitutions in sample population grouped according to skin, hair and eye pigmentation levels. In nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS), three main clusters were identified, in which the Brazilian dark skin group remained in the African cluster whereas the intermediate and the light skin color phenotype in the European one. None gathered with Asians since their immigration to Brazil was a recent event. In silico analyses demonstrated that Cys35Tyr, Ile155Thr and Pro256Ser, found in our population, have a negative effect on receptor function probably due to changes on the receptor structure. Notably, Cys35Tyr mutation could potentially impair agonist binding. Altogether, this work contributes to the understanding of the genetic background of color variation on an admixed population and gives insights into the damaging effects of MC1R variants.",

        abstract: "Membranous nephropathy is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Recent reports suggest that treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) reduces proteinuria, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we identified gene expression of the melanocortin receptor MC1R in podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, and tubular epithelial cells. Podocytes expressed most MC1R protein, which colocalized with synaptopodin but not with an endothelial-specific lectin. We treated rats with passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) with MS05, a specific MC1R agonist, which significantly reduced proteinuria compared with untreated PHN rats (P < 0.01). Furthermore, treatment with MC1R agonists improved podocyte morphology and reduced oxidative stress. In summary, podocytes express MC1R, and MC1R agonism reduces proteinuria, improves glomerular morphology, and reduces oxidative stress in nephrotic rats with PHN. These data may explain the proteinuria-reducing effects of ACTH observed in patients with membranous nephropathy, and MC1R agonists may provide a new therapeutic option for these patients.",

        abstract: "Nature provides a primary source of leads for the design of π-conjugated organic chromophores and other functional molecular systems useful for molecular recognition, light harvesting, photoconversion, and other technological applications. In this Account, we draw attention to a unique group of naturally occurring heterocyclic compounds, the 2H-1,4-benzothiazines and related benzothiazole derivatives. Derived from tyrosine and cysteine, these molecules arise from a mutation-induced deviation of the melanin pathway to provide the core structure of the red human hair pigments pheomelanins. Since the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of pheomelanins in the 1960s, researchers have focused on 1,4-benzothiazines and red hair pigments. Not only do these molecules have interesting photochemical and molecular recognition properties, they also have compelling biomedical significance. Numerous studies have linked higher levels of pheomelanins and mutations in the pathways that produce these pigments in individuals with red hair and fair skin with an increased sensitivity to UV light and a higher susceptibility to melanoma and other skin cancers. Prompted by new data about the structure and photochemistry of the bibenzothiazine system, this Account highlights the chemistry of benzothiazines in red-haired individuals as a novel source of inspiration in the quest for innovative scaffolds and biomimetic functional systems. Model studies have gradually shed light on a number of remarkable physical and chemical properties of benzothiazine-based systems. Bibenzothiazine is a robust visible chromophore that combines photochromism and acidichromism. Benzothiazine-based polymers (synthetic pheomelanins) show remarkable photochemical, paramagnetic, and redox cycling properties. Biomimetic or synthetic manipulations of the benzothiazine systems, through decarboxylation pathways controlled by metal ions or unusually facile ring-contraction processes, can produce a diverse set of molecular scaffolds.",

        abstract: "Activation of melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is known to exert broad anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of dersimelagon, a novel oral MC1R agonist, as a therapeutic agent for systemic sclerosis (SSc). The effects of dersimelagon phosphoric acid (MT-7117) on skin fibrosis and lung inflammation were evaluated in bleomycin (BLM)-induced SSc murine models that were optimized for prophylactic and therapeutic evaluation. Microarray-based gene expression analysis and serum protein profiling were performed in the BLM-induced SSc models. The effect of MT-7117 on transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced activation of human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated in vitro. Immunohistochemical analyses of MC1R expression in the skin of SSc patients were performed. Prophylactic treatment with MT-7117 (≥ 0.3 mg/kg/day p.o.) significantly inhibited skin fibrosis and lung inflammation, and therapeutic treatment with MT-7117 (≥ 3 mg/kg/day p.o.) significantly suppressed the development of skin fibrosis in the BLM-induced SSc models. Gene array analysis demonstrated that MT-7117 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via suppression of the activation of inflammatory cells and inflammation-related signals; additionally, vascular dysfunction was extracted as the pathology targeted by MT-7117. Serum protein profiling revealed that multiple SSc-related biomarkers including P-selectin, osteoprotegerin, cystatin C, growth and differentiation factor-15, and S100A9 were suppressed by MT-7117. MT-7117 inhibited the activation of human dermal fibroblasts by suppressing TGF-β-induced ACTA2 (encoding α-smooth muscle actin) mRNA elevation. MC1R was expressed by monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, blood vessels (endothelial cells), fibroblasts, and epidermis (keratinocytes) in the skin of SSc patients, suggesting that these MC1R-positive cells could be targets for MT-7117. MT-7117 demonstrates disease-modifying effects in preclinical models of SSc. Investigations of its mechanism of action and target expression analyses indicate that MT-7117 exerts its positive effect by affecting inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and fibrosis, which are all key pathologies of SSc. The results of the present study suggest that MT-7117 is a potential therapeutic agent for SSc. A phase 2 clinical trial investigating the efficacy and tolerability of MT-7117 in patients with early, progressive diffuse cutaneous SSc is currently in progress.",

        abstract: "The genetic basis underlying normal variation in the pigmentary traits of skin, hair and eye colour has been the subject of intense research directed at understanding the diversity seen both between and within human populations. A combination of approaches have been used including comparative genomics of candidate genes and the identification of regions of the human genome under positive selection, together with genome-wide and specific allele association studies. Independent selection for different pigmentation gene sets has been found between Asian, European and African populations. Several genome-wide association studies for pigmentation have now been conducted and identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in known, TYR, TYRP1, OCA2, SLC45A2, SLC24A5, MC1R, ASIP, KITLG and previously unknown SLC24A4, IRF4, TPCN2, candidate genes. The contribution of SNP polymorphisms present in populations from South Asia have been tested and alleles found at TYR, SLC45A2 and SLC24A5 can largely account for differences between those of darkest and lightest skin reflectance using a simple additive model. Skin and hair colour associations in Europeans are found within a range of pigmentation gene alleles, whereas blue-brown eye colour can be explained by a single SNP proposed to regulate OCA2 expression. Functional testing of variant alleles has begun to connect phenotype correlations with biological differences. Variant MC1R alleles show direct correlations between the biochemical signalling properties of the encoded receptor and the red-hair fair skin pigmentation phenotype. Direct testing of a range of clonal melanocyte cultures derived from donor skin tissue characterized for three causal SNPs within SLC45A2, SLC24A5 and OCA2 has assessed their impact on melanin content and tyrosinase enzyme activity. From a culmination of genetic and functional studies, it is apparent that a number of genes impacting melanosome biogenesis or the melanin biosynthetic pathway are candidates to explain the diversity seen in human pigmentation.",

We used whole-exome sequencing to identify causative alleles in Pakistani families with skin and hair hypopigmentation. Six MC1R mutations segregated with the phenotype in seven families, including a p.Val174del in-frame deletion and a p.Tyr298* nonsense mutation, that were analyzed for function in heterologous HEK293 cells. p.Tyr298* MC1R showed no agonist-induced signaling to the cAMP or ERK pathways, nor detectable agonist binding. Conversely, signaling was comparable for p.Val174del and wild-type in HEK cells overexpressing the proteins, but binding analysis suggested impaired cell surface expression. Flow cytometry and confocal imaging studies revealed reduced plasma membrane expression of p.Val174del and p.Tyr298*. Therefore, p.Tyr298* was a total loss-of-function (LOF) allele, while p.Val174del displayed a partial LOF attribute.",

        title: "Distinct cAMP Signaling Microdomains Differentially Regulate Melanosomal pH and Pigmentation.",
        abstract: "cAMP signaling is a well-established regulator of melanin synthesis. Two distinct cAMP signaling pathways-the transmembrane adenylyl cyclase pathway, activated primarily by the MC1R, and the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) pathway-affect melanin synthesis. The sAC pathway affects melanin synthesis by regulating melanosomal pH, and the MC1R pathway affects melanin synthesis by regulating gene expression and post-translational modifications. However, whether MC1R genotype affects melanosomal pH is poorly understood. We now report that loss of function MC1R does not affect melanosomal pH. Thus, sAC signaling appears to be the only cAMP signaling pathway that regulates melanosomal pH. We also addressed whether MC1R genotype affects sAC-dependent regulation of melanin synthesis. Although sAC loss of function in wild-type human melanocytes stimulates melanin synthesis, sAC loss of function has no effect on melanin synthesis in MC1R nonfunctional human and mouse melanocytes or skin and hair melanin in e/e mice. Interestingly, activation of transmembrane adenylyl cyclases, which increases epidermal eumelanin synthesis in e/e mice, leads to enhanced production of eumelanin in sAC-knockout mice relative to that in sAC wild-type mice. Thus, MC1R- and sAC-dependent cAMP signaling pathways define distinct mechanisms that regulate melanosomal pH and pigmentation.",

        abstract: "The aim of the study was to determine if melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with complicated sepsis after trauma. Nosocomial infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality after trauma. Several SNPs in inflammation-related genes have been associated with sepsis. MC1R is an anti-inflammatory mediator that may be involved in the immune response after trauma. We genotyped eight common MC1R SNPs in genomic DNA from subjects enrolled in a previously reported prospective cohort study. Subjects were adult trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit at a Level 1 trauma center (2003-2005). A total of 1,246 subjects were included in the analysis. The majority were male (70%), severely injured (81%), and injured by a blunt mechanism (89%). Forty percent developed sepsis, and 23% developed complicated sepsis, which was defined as sepsis with organ dysfunction. In logistic regression analysis, with adjustments for age, sex, body mass index, injury severity score, red blood cell transfusion requirement, and mechanism of injury, the MC1RR163Q variant (rs885479) was associated with a lower risk of developing complicated sepsis (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28-0.81, P = 0.006). In a subgroup of 511 subjects with genome-wide SNP data, the association between the MC1RR163Q variant and complicated sepsis remained significant after adjusting for genetic substructure (by principal components) and the above clinical factors (ORadj = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.13-0.70, P = 0.005). MC1RR163Q is associated with a lower risk of complicated sepsis after trauma. Therapeutic targeting of MC1R may be beneficial for trauma patients at risk for complicated sepsis.",

        abstract: "The characterization of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) expressed on human melanocytes and the findings that certain mutations in the POMC gene or the MC1R gene result in red hair phenotype underscore the significance of melanocortins and MC1R in regulating human pigmentation. We demonstrated that human melanocytes respond to alpha-melanocortin (alpha-MSH) or ACTH with increased proliferation and melanogenesis, and to agouti signaling protein by abrogation of these effects. alpha-MSH and ACTH were equipotent and more potent than beta-MSH, and gamma-MSH was the least potent in activating the MC1R and stimulating melanogenesis and proliferation of human melanocytes. We characterized the MC1R genotype in a panel of human melanocyte cultures and identified three cultures that were homozygous for Arg160Trp, heterozygous for Arg151Cys and Asp294His, and heterozygous for Arg160Trp and Asp294His substitutions, respectively. Those cultures failed to respond to alpha-MSH with increase in cAMP levels, tyrosinase activity, or proliferation and had an exaggerated response to the cytotoxic effect of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These loss-of-function mutations have been associated with red hair phenotype and increased risk for skin cancer. Melanocytes homozygous for Val29Met substitution in MC1R responded normally to alpha-MSH and UVB, suggesting that this variant is a polymorphism. We observed that alpha-MSH promotes human melanocyte survival by inhibiting the UV-induced apoptosis independently of melanin synthesis. This effect was absent in human melanocytes with loss of function MC1R mutations. We predict that the survival effect of alpha-MSH is caused by reduction of UV-induced DNA damage and contributes to the prevention of melanoma.",

        abstract: "Solar ultraviolet radiation exposure has been inversely related to prostate cancer incidence and mortality, possibly mediated through vitamin D status. Pigmentation-related traits influence endogenous vitamin D synthesis and may alter risk of prostate cancer. We examined prostate cancer in relation to hair and eye colour, and skin phototype in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort. Incident cancer was diagnosed in 1982 out of 20 863 men. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazards models. Prostate cancer risk did not differ by eye colour or skin phototype. Men with naturally red hair were significantly less likely to develop prostate cancer (HR=0.46, 95% CI 0.24-0.89) than men with light brown hair (reference). The red hair phenotype, which results from polymorphisms in the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene, is associated with lower risk of prostate cancer. This pigmentation-related trait may influence prostate cancer development either directly, through genetic effects or regulatory mechanisms related to MC1R, another nearby gene, or other pigmentation genes, or indirectly, through associations with other exposures such as sunlight or vitamin D status.",

        abstract: "Genetic variation in melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) has a known role in red hair. Studies on responses to noxious stimuli in red-haired individuals have also been conducted, with mixed findings. To investigate a possible divergence between variants responsible for red hair and pain sensitivity, we performed a genewide association analysis in the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment cohort. All genotyped (17) MC1R variants were tested for association with heat pain temporal summation and sensitivity. Our analyses showed an association for pain sensitivity with the 5'-UTR, tagged by rs3212361, and 1 missense variant, rs885479 (R163Q), previously shown to be weakly associated with red hair. For both variants, the minor allele was protective. These results were validated in the 500,000-person UK Biobank cohort, where the minor alleles of rs3212361 and rs885479 were associated with a reduced count of persistent pain conditions as well as individual pain conditions. Haplotype association analysis revealed a possible joint effect from the 2 individual variants. The 5'-UTR variant rs3212361 was further identified as an expression quantitative trait locus, associated with reduced transcript levels of MC1R in the brain and in the peripheral tibial nerve. Hair colour association analysis of the loss-of-function 5'-UTR rs3212361 allele identified association with red hair, and red hair colour itself was associated with a reduced count of persistent pain conditions. Together, our results suggest that primarily different mechanisms-affecting expression levels vs protein activity-mediated by different genetic variants in the MC1R locus contribute to red hair and pain.",

        abstract: "Several angiogenesis-dependent diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and infantile hemangioma, display differential prevalence among Black, as compared to White individuals. Although socioeconomic status and genetic architecture have been suggested as explaining these differences, we have recently shown that pigment production per se might be involved. For example, we have shown that the extracellular protein fibromodulin is a pro-angiogenic factor highly secreted by melanocytes in White but not Black individuals. Still, additional pigment-dependent angiogenic factors and their molecular mechanisms remain to be identified. Understanding the contribution of pigmentation to angiogenesis in health and disease is essential for precision medicine of angiogenesis-dependent diseases with racial disparity. Toward that goal, we compared the transcriptomes of Black and White individuals in three tissues with angiogenic activity, namely artery, whole blood, and skin. We identified several differentially expressed angiogenesis pathways, including artery morphogenesis, regulation of endothelial cell chemotaxis, and cellular response to vascular endothelial growth factor stimulus. We then demonstrated that the expression of key genes in these pathways is directly modulated by the degree of pigmentation. We further identified the precise pigment production pathway controlling the expression of these genes, namely melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) signaling. These results demonstrate pigment-mediated regulation of angiogenesis-related pathways and their driver genes across human tissues.",

        abstract: "Skin is a target organ and source of the corticotropin-releasing hormone-proopiomelanocortin (CRH-POMC) system, operating as a coordinator and executor of responses to stress. Environmental stress exacerbates and triggers inflammatory skin diseases through modifying the cellular components of the immune system supporting the importance of CRH-POMC system in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The aim of this study was to analyse the association of CRH-POMC polymorphisms with psoriasis and evaluate transcript expression of lesional psoriatic and normal skin in RNA-seq data. Samples of 104 patients with psoriasis and 174 healthy controls were genotyped for 42 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CRH-POMC using Applied Biosystems SNPlex™ method. The transcript quantification was performed using Salmon software v1.3.0. This study demonstrated the associations between melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) polymorphisms rs2228479, rs3212369, dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) polymorphisms rs7987802, rs2031526, rs9524501 and psoriasis in the Tatar population. Very strong association was evident for the SNP rs7987802 in the DCT gene (p<sub>c</sub>  = 5.95е-006) in psoriasis patients. Additionally, the haplotype analysis provided AT DCT (rs7992630 and rs7987802) and AGA MC1R (rs3212358, 2228479 and 885479) haplotypes significantly associated (p<sub>c</sub>  ˂ 0.05) with psoriasis in the Tatar population, supporting the involvement of DCT and MC1R to the psoriasis susceptibility. Moreover, MC1R-203 and DCT-201 expression levels were decreased in psoriasis lesional skin compared with healthy control skin. This study is the first to identify genetic variants of the MC1R and DCT genes significantly associated with psoriasis in Tatar population. Our results support potential roles of CRH-POMC system genes and DCT in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.",

Established risk factors that increase susceptibility to skin cancer after transplantation include skin type, sun exposure and level of immunosuppression. A comprehensive literature review was carried out to discuss relevant genetic polymorphism for the development of skin cancer in organ transplant recipients. These include genetic polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferase, interleukin-10, retinoblastoma and p53 genes. We also discuss genetic polymorphisms in the folate pathway, melanocortin 1 receptor and vitamin D receptor recently discovered in our group. No single factor is causative in cutaneous carcinogenesis in transplant recipients. Interactions of some of the above mechanisms with known environmental factors lead to increased risk. Polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase are potentially correctable with folic acid supplementation; however, further evaluation is required in adequately powered prospective clinical trials. Avoidance of known oncogenic environmental factors and genetic risk evaluation may improve outcomes in transplant patients.",

We identified numerous SNPs, haplotypes, and diplotypes (diploid pairs of haplotypes) within the OCA2, MYO5A, TYRP1, AIM, DCT, and TYR genes and the CYP1A2-15q22-ter, CYP1B1-2p21, CYP2C8-10q23, CYP2C9-10q24, and MAOA-Xp11.4 regions as significantly associated with iris colors. Half of the associated SNPs were located on chromosome 15, which corresponds with results that others have previously obtained from linkage analysis. We identified 5 additional genes (ASIP, MC1R, POMC, and SILV) and one additional region (GSTT2-22q11.23) with haplotype and/or diplotypes, but not individual SNP alleles associated with iris colors. For most of the genes, multilocus gene-wise genotype sequences were more strongly associated with iris colors than were haplotypes or SNP alleles. Diplotypes for these genes explain 15% of iris color variation. Apart from representing the first comprehensive candidate gene study for variable iris pigmentation and constituting a first step toward developing a classification model for the inference of iris color from DNA, our results suggest that cryptic population structure might serve as a leverage tool for complex trait gene mapping if genomes are screened with the appropriate ancestry informative markers.",

There was a statistically significant positive correlation between lesional levels of POMC and MC1R, as well as between non-lesional levels of POMC and MC1R in the patients. On the other hand, we found a statistically significant negative correlation between the lesional and non-lesional levels of POMC, as well as between the lesional and non-lesional levels of MC1R in the patients. As a conclusion, the melanocortin system could play a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo or could be affected as the end result of the disease.",

        abstract: "The melanocortin 1 receptor is a Gs protein-coupled receptor implicated in melanogenesis regulation. The receptor gene is highly polymorphic, which accounts for the association of several of its single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an increased risk of melanoma. The present study aimed to evaluate the distribution of melanocortin 1 receptor gene variants R151C, R160W, and D294H within the Russian population of Eastern Siberia and its association with melanoma development. Melanoma patients (n=95) admitted to Krasnoyarsk Territorial Oncological Center and healthy controls (n=334) were enrolled in the study. A clinical examination of patients was performed to evaluate the phenotypic features of melanoma patients. SNPs were analyzed by real-time PCR. Clinical examination indicated a more frequent occurrence of fair skin type, blue eyes, blonde and red hair, and more frequent localization of freckles on the neck, trunk, and extremities in the melanoma group of patients. The R151C melanocortin 1 receptor gene variant was found in 18% of melanoma patients and associated with an increased likelihood of melanoma development (odds ratio=6.4; 95% confidence interval: 2.8-14.3; P=0.0001). The two remaining variant alleles of the melanocortin 1 receptor gene occurred with low frequency both in controls and in the melanoma group. The R160W SNP was identified neither in controls nor in melanoma patients. The D294H heterozygous variant was observed in 0.3% of individuals in the control group and in 1.1% of the patients in the melanoma group. Such an asymmetric distribution of the melanocortin 1 receptor within red hair color genotypes in the population under study compared with other populations may be because of Russian genetic homogeneity. Carriers of the mutant R151C allele should exercise caution in terms of exposure to the sun to avoid the risk of melanoma development.",

        abstract: "Ephelides and solar lentigines are different types of pigmented skin lesions. Ephelides appear early in childhood and are associated with fair skin type and red hair. Solar lentigines appear with increasing age and are a sign of photodamage. Both lesions are strong risk indicators for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene variants are also associated with fair skin, red hair and melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between MC1R gene variants, ephelides and solar lentigines. In a large case-control study, patients with melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer and subjects without a history of skin cancer were studied. In all participants, the presence of ephelides in childhood and solar lentigines by physical examination was assessed according to strict definitions. The entire coding sequence of the MC1R gene was analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by sequence analyses. Carriers of one or two MC1R gene variants had a 3- and 11-fold increased risk of developing ephelides, respectively (both P < 0.0001), whereas the risk of developing severe solar lentigines was increased 1.5- and 2-fold (P = 0.035 and P < 0.0001), respectively. These associations were independent of skin type and hair color, and were comparable in patients with and without a history of skin cancer. The population attributable risk for ephelides to MC1R gene variants was 60%, i.e. 60% of the ephelides in the population was caused by MC1R gene variants. A dosage effect was found between the degree of ephelides and the number of MC1R gene variants. As nearly all individuals with ephelides were carriers of at least one MC1R gene variant, our data suggest that MC1R gene variants are necessary to develop ephelides. The results of the study also suggest that MC1R gene variants play a role, although less important, in the development of solar lentigines.",

        abstract: "Signaling from the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crucial for melanocyte proliferation and differentiation, is regulated by cytosolic β-arrestins (ARRBs). MC1R signaling is also negatively modulated by the E3-ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1), whose mutation causes hyperpigmentation, congenital heart defects and neurodegeneration in mice. We showed previously that although MC1R interacts stably with human ARRB1 or ARRB2, only ARRB2 mediates receptor desensitization and internalization. We analyzed MC1R-dependent ARRB ubiquitination, and the possible role of MGRN1. ARRB1 expressed in heterologous cells or human melanoma cells migrated in SDS-PAGE as a 55kDa protein whereas ARRB2 migrated as two major bands of apparent molecular weight near 45 and 55kDa, with an intermediate mobility band occasionally detected. These forms were related by post-translational modification rather than by proteolysis. Presence of MC1R favored expression of the 45kDa protein, the form that interacted preferentially with MC1R. MC1R also mediated poly- or multimonoubiquitination of ARRB2. Ubiquitination was agonist-independent, but required a native MC1R conformation and/or normal receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane, as it was not observed for loss-of-function MC1R variants. In a heterologous expression system, MC1R-dependent ARRB ubiquitination was enhanced by overexpression of MGRN1 and was impaired by siRNA-mediated MGRN1 knockdown thus pointing to MGRN1 as the responsible E3-ligase. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated interaction of MGRN1 and ARRBs in the presence of MC1R, suggesting a scaffolding role for the GPCR that may determine the selectivity of E3-ubiquitin ligase engagement and the functional outcome of ARRB ubiquitination.",

        abstract: "Skin cancer risk information based on melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) variants could inform prevention and screening recommendations for Hispanics, but limited evidence exists on the impact of MC1R variants in Hispanic populations. We studied Hispanic subjects, predominately of Puerto Rican heritage, from Tampa, Florida, US, and Ponce, PR. Blood or saliva samples were collected by prospective recruitment or retrieved from biobanks for genotyping of MC1R variants and ancestry informative markers. Participant demographic and self-reported phenotypic information was collected via biobank records or questionnaires. We determined associations of MC1R genetic risk categories and phenotypic variables and genetic ancestry. Over half of participants carried MC1R variants known to increase risk of skin cancer, and there was diversity in the observed variants across sample populations. Associations between MC1R genetic risk groups and some pigmentation characteristics were identified. Among Puerto Ricans, the proportion of participants carrying MC1R variants imparting elevated skin cancer risk was consistent across quartiles of European, African, and Native American genetic ancestry. These findings demonstrate that MC1R variants are important for pigmentation characteristics in Hispanics and that carriage of high risk MC1R alleles occurs even among Hispanics with stronger African or Native American genetic ancestry.",

        abstract: "We review the general amount and patterns of exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation that children and teenagers experience and the spectrum of UV-related skin damage that can occur as a result. Data about the amount of solar UV received by children and teenagers are relatively few but suggest that around 40-50% of total UV to age 60 occurs before age 20. Among white children, those with the palest complexions suffer the most damage. Comparisons of prevalence and incidence of outcomes in children and teenagers sharing common ancestry, but living at different latitudes, show that prevalence rates of photoaging and melanocytic naevi are higher in Australian compared with British children, and similarly for melanoma. Genetic risk for the majority of the melanomas in teens is a function of genes controlling naevus propensity and pigmentation in the skin. High numbers of naevi and freckles, red hair, blue eyes, inability to tan, as well as a family history are the primary determinants of melanoma among adolescents. Beyond the signs of skin damage seen in children are the latent effects observed later in adulthood. Childhood is believed to be a susceptible window for long-term harmful effects of UV, as evidenced by clear differences in skin cancer risk between child and adult migrants from high to low latitudes. Effective UV radiation protection from childhood is necessary to control both immediate and long-term harmful effects on children's skin.",

        abstract: "We performed a meta-analysis to assess whether MC1R variants increase the risk of melanoma in CDKN2A mutation carriers of melanoma-prone families. Data from 96 CDKN2A-positive melanoma-prone families from seven independent populations of Europe, United States and Australia were included in the analysis. Summary risk estimates were calculated by random-effect models. We explored between-study heterogeneity and publication bias. Association between MC1R variants and age at diagnosis was assessed by the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. CDKN2A mutation carriers with 1 MC1R variant showed a double melanoma risk as compared to CDKN2A mutation carriers without MC1R variants (Summary OR; 95%CI: 2.2; 1.1-4.5). MC1R heterozygous subjects had no significantly higher melanoma risk than wild-type subjects (1.6; 0.5-5.4) while carriers of multiple MC1R variants had a more than four-times higher melanoma risk (4.6; 1.3-16.4). Carriers of red hair colour (RHC) variants showed an increased melanoma risk with a Summary OR of 3.5 (95%CI: 1.3-9.9). CDKN2A mutation carriers with MC1R variants had a statistically significant lower median age at melanoma diagnosis than CDKN2A mutation carriers with no MC1R variants (37years versus 47years, p-value<0.0001). MC1R variants significantly increase penetrance of CDKN2A mutations in melanoma-prone families, especially with respect to multiple MC1R variants and to RHC variants. A significant anticipation of melanoma diagnosis is observed in CDKN2A mutation carriers with MC1R variants.",

        abstract: "The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is a subtype of the melanocortin receptor family and NDP-α-MSH is a non-selective agonist for MC1R. The core sequence of NDP-α-MSH, His-Phe-Arg-Trp, is important for ligand binding and biological activities at the melanocortin receptor subtypes (MCRs). A recent study indicates that Trp<sup>9</sup> in NDP-α-MSH plays an important role in ligand selectivity. Deletion of Trp<sup>9</sup> in NDP-α-MSH (des-Trp<sup>9</sup>-NDP-α-MSH) resulted in loss of agonist activity at MC4R, although remains agonist activity at MC1R. The molecular basis for this receptor ligand selectivity is unknown. In this study we examined what region of the MC1R is responsible for des-NDP-α-MSH selectivity. Our results indicate that (1) substitution of TM3 of MC4R with the corresponding region of MC1R switches des-Trp<sup>9</sup>-NDP-α-MSH from no activity to agonist; (2) des-Trp<sup>9</sup>-NDP-α-MSH exhibits agonistic activity at the L133M mutation of the MC4R; and (3) substitution of non-conserved amino acid residue M128 in TM3 of MC1R significantly reduced des-Trp<sup>9</sup>-NDP-α-MSH agonist activity. Our results demonstrate that amino acid residue 128 in TM3 of MC1R, or amino acid residue L133 in TM3 of the MC4R, play crucial roles in ligand des-Trp<sup>9</sup>-NDP-α-MSH selectivity at MC1R or MC4R.",

We examined whether hair color, one of the most important phenotypes of pigmentation and a risk factor for melanoma, was associated with PD risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; 1986-2002) and the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1980-2002). We included 38,641 men and 93,661 women who were free of PD at baseline. Information on natural hair color in early adulthood (age 18-21 years) was assessed via a questionnaire. We also conducted a case-control study (298 PD cases) nested in these two cohorts to examine the association between the melanocortin1-receptor Arg151Cys polymorphism and PD risk. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models in the cohort analyses and conditional logistic regression in the nested case-control study. PD risk increased with decreasing darkness of hair color. Pooled RRs for PD were 1 (reference), 1.40, 1.61, and 1.93 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.4) for black, brown, blond, and red hair, respectively, after adjusting for age, smoking, ethnicity, and other covariates. The associations between hair color and PD were particularly strong for relative younger onset of PD (<70 yr) (adjusted RR for red vs black hair = 3.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-8.7). In the case-control study, participants with Cys/Cys genotype, which was associated with red hair, had a greater PD risk, relative to the Arg/Arg genotype (adjusted RR, 3.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.4). These findings suggest a potential role of pigmentation in PD.",

        abstract: "Melanosomes are the specialized intracellular organelles of pigment cells devoted to the synthesis, storage and transport of melanin pigments, which are responsible for most visible pigmentation in mammals and other vertebrates. As a direct consequence, any genetic mutation resulting in alteration of melanosomal function, either because affecting pigment cell survival, migration and differentiation, or because interfering with melanosome biogenesis, transport and transfer to keratinocytes, is immediately translated into color variations of skin, fur, hair or eyes. Thus, over 100 genes and proteins have been identified as pigmentary determinants in mammals, providing us with a deep understanding of this biological system, which functions by using mechanisms and processes that have parallels in other tissues and organs. In particular, many genes implicated in melanosome biogenesis have been characterized, so that melanosomes represent an incredible source of information and a model for organelles belonging to the secretory pathway. Furthermore, the function of melanosomes can be associated with common physiological phenotypes, such as variation of pigmentation among individuals, and with rare pathological conditions, such as albinism, characterized by severe visual defects. Among the most relevant mechanisms operating in melanosome biogenesis are the signal transduction pathways mediated by two peculiar G protein-coupled receptors: the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), involved in the fair skin/red hair phenotype and skin cancer; and OA1 (GPR143), whose loss-of-function results in X-linked ocular albinism. This review will focus on the most recent novelties regarding the functioning of these two receptors, by highlighting emerging signaling mechanisms and general implications for cell biology and pathology.",

Interventions in college settings have relied on appearance-focused appeals and have not been able to examine the cumulative effect of multiple behavior change and skin cancer risk communication strategies. The goal of the current study was to examine the unique and combined impacts of personalized ultraviolet (UV) radiation photographs, genetic testing for skin cancer risk, and general skin cancer prevention education. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) skin cancer prevention education, (2) education + UV photo, (3) education + genetic testing, and (4) education + UV photo + genetic testing. Self-reported sun protection, tanning, and sunburn were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 1 month post-intervention. The findings indicated benefits of the interventions to skin cancer prevention behaviors in the overall sample; however, the combined (UV photo + genetic testing) intervention had the most consistent positive effects on behaviors. Intervention effects were distinct across seasons. These results suggest that interventions containing multiple skin cancer risk communication strategies hold promise in benefitting health-promoting behavior changes in an at-risk, young adult population.Trial Registration Number: NCT03979872; Registered 6/5/2019.",

        title: "Sequence polymorphisms of MC1R gene and their association with depression and antidepressant response.",
        abstract: "Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is involved in various functions, such as pigmentation, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory actions, development of melanoma, susceptibility to ultraviolet-induced sun damage, modification of oculocutaneous albinism, development of freckles, and mediation of female-specific mechanisms of analgesia. MC1R's natural agonists include α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and corticotrophin (ACTH1-39), which are important components of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and increase in response to stress. Given the multiple relevant roles of MC1R, we studied whether the MC1R gene would be associated with susceptibility to major depressive disorder or with response to antidepressant treatment. The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic; therefore, we sequenced the entire MC1R coding region of 1122 bp in 181 depressed Mexican-American patients and 185 Mexican-American controls. A total of 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, 15 known and eight new) were found within the sequenced region. Among the common SNPs, the nonsynonymous SNP, rs885479 (R163Q) was associated with the diagnosis of depression (P=0.04). The nonsynonymous SNP, rs2228479 (V92M) and the synonymous SNP, rs2228478 were found to be associated with the remission with desipramine treatment. No associations were found for remission with fluoxetine treatment or for the combined sample treated with fluoxetine or desipramine. The frequency of one (H2) of the five haplotypes identified was higher in depressed patients when compared with controls (P=0.05). In-silico functional analysis indicates that SNPs rs885479 and rs2228479 have significant impact on the protein function. The MC1R gene might be associated with major depressive disorder and with treatment response to desipramine.",

        abstract: "The genetic determinants of post-burn hypertrophic scarring (HTS) are unknown, and melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) loss-of-function leads to fibrogenesis in experimental models. To examine the associations between self-identified race and MC1R single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with severity of post-burn HTS, we conducted a prospective cohort study of burned adults admitted to our institution over 7 years. Subjects were evaluated using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), asked to rate their itching, and genotyped for 8 MC1R SNPs. Testing for association with severe HTS (VSS>7) and itch severity (0-10) was based on multivariate regression with adjustment for known risk factors. Of 425 subjects analyzed, 77% identified as White. The prevalence of severe HTS (VSS>7) was 49%, and the mean itch score was 3.9. In multivariate analysis, Asian (prevalence ratio (PR) 1.54; 95% CI: 1.13-2.10), Black/African American (PR 1.86; 95% CI: 1.42-2.45), and Native American (PR 1.87; 95% CI: 1.48-2.35) race were independently associated with severe HTS. MC1R SNP R163Q was also significantly (P<0.001) associated with severe HTS. Asian race (linear regression coefficient 1.32; 95% CI: 0.23-2.40) but not MC1R SNP genotype was associated with increased itch score. We conclude that MC1R genotype may influence post-burn scarring.",

        abstract: "Here we report a heterozygous tandem duplication at the ASIP (agouti signaling protein) gene locus causing ubiquitous, ectopic ASIP expression in a female patient with extreme childhood obesity. The mutation places ASIP under control of the ubiquitously active itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase promoter, driving the generation of ASIP in patient-derived native and induced pluripotent stem cells for all germ layers and hypothalamic-like neurons. The patient's phenotype of early-onset obesity, overgrowth, red hair and hyperinsulinemia is concordant with that of mutant mice ubiquitously expressing the homolog nonagouti. ASIP represses melanocyte-stimulating hormone-mediated activation as a melanocortin receptor antagonist, which might affect eating behavior, energy expenditure, adipocyte differentiation and pigmentation, as observed in the index patient. As the type of mutation escapes standard genetic screening algorithms, we rescreened the Leipzig Childhood Obesity cohort of 1,745 patients and identified four additional patients with the identical mutation, ectopic ASIP expression and a similar phenotype. Taken together, our data indicate that ubiquitous ectopic ASIP expression is likely a monogenic cause of human obesity.",

        abstract: "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder occurring in women of reproductive age. The disease is caused by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors including genes encoding components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We have recently reported the association of melanocortin receptor genes (MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R) with the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and/or major depressive disorder (MDD). The latter 2 disorders are comorbid with PCOS. In this study, we used microarray to test 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MC1R gene, 10 SNPs in the MC2R gene, 5 SNPs in the MC3R gene, 6 SNPs in the MC4R gene, and 4 SNPs in the MC5R gene in 212 original Italian families with PCOS. We identified 1 SNP in MC1R, 1 SNP in MC2R, 2 SNPs in MC3R, and 2 SNPs in MC5R significantly linked and/or associated to/with the risk of PCOS in Italian families. This is the first study to report the novel implication of melanocortin receptor genes (MC1R, MC2R, and MC5R) in PCOS. MC3R and MC4R were previously reported in PCOS. However, functional studies are needed to validate these results.",

        title: "Genetics of pigmentation in skin cancer--a review.",
        abstract: "Skin pigmentation is one of the most overt human physical traits with consequences on susceptibility to skin cancer. The variations in skin pigmentation are dependent on geographic location and population ethnicity. Skin colouration is mainly due to the pigmentation substance melanin, produced in specialized organelles (melanosomes) within dendritic melanocytes, and transferred to neighbouring keratinocytes. The two types of melanin synthesized in well defined chemical reactions are the protective dark coloured eumelanin and the sulphur containing light red-yellow pheomelanin. The events leading to the synthesis of melanin are controlled by signalling cascades that involve a host of genes encoding ligands, receptors, transcription factors, channel transporters and many other crucial molecules. Several variants within the genes involved in pigmentation have been associated with high risk phenotypes like fair skin, brown-red hair and green-blue eyes. Many of those variants have also been implicated in the risk of various skin cancers. The variants within the key pigmentation gene, melanocortin-receptor 1 (MC1R), in particular have been ubiquitously linked with high risk traits and skin cancers involving both pigmentary and non-pigmentary functions and likely interaction with variants in other genes. Many of the variants in other genes, functional in pigmentation pathway, have also been associated with phenotypic variation and risk of skin cancers. Those genes include agouti signalling protein (ASIP), tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2), various solute carrier genes and transporters. Most of those associations have been confirmed in genome wide association studies that at the same time have also identified new loci involved in phenotypic variation and skin cancer risk. In conclusion, the genetic variants within the genes involved in skin pigmentation besides influencing phenotypic traits are important determinants of risk of several skin cancers. However, ultimate risk of skin cancer is dependent on interplay between genetic and host factors.",

        abstract: "The syndrome of adrenal insufficiency, obesity, and red hair is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The majority of disease-causing variants associated with the syndrome are located in the coding region of the POMC gene. This work describes 7 unrelated patients who shared a novel homozygous mutation in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the POMC gene and functionally characterize this novel variant. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) with autozygosity mapping, Sanger sequencing, model expression system studies, and RNA sequencing were used for identification of the disease-causing variant and its subsequent functional characterization. Seven unrelated patients of the Perm Tatar ethnic group presented with hypoglycemia and excessive weight gain, low plasma adrenocorticotropin, and cortisol. Five of 7 children had red hair; 6 of 7 patients also showed signs of bronchial obstruction. WES showed shared autozygosity regions overlapping the POMC gene. Sanger sequencing of the POMC 5'-UTR detected a homozygous variant chr2:25391366C > T (hg19) at the splice donor site of intron 1. As demonstrated by the model expression system, the variant led to a significant decrease in the POMC messenger RNA level. Analyses of the patients' haplotypes were suggestive of the founder effect. We estimate that the mutation must have occurred at least 4.27 generations ago (95% CI, 0.86-7.67). This report presents a new molecular mechanism of POMC deficiency and contributes to the information on phenotypic variability in patients with this disorder.",

        abstract: "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) incidence is increasing, particularly in young people, and can be associated with significant morbidity and treatment costs. To identify young individuals at risk of BCC, we assessed existing melanoma or overall skin cancer risk prediction models and built a novel risk prediction model, with a focus on indoor tanning and the melanocortin 1 receptor gene, MC1R. We evaluated logistic regression models among 759 non-Hispanic whites from a case-control study of patients seen between 2006 and 2010 in New Haven, Connecticut. In our data, the adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for a model by Han et al. (Int J Cancer. 2006;119(8):1976-1984) with 7 MC1R variants was 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66, 0.78), while that by Smith et al. (J Clin Oncol. 2012;30(15 suppl):8574) with MC1R and indoor tanning had an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.75). Our base model had greater predictive ability than existing models and was significantly improved when we added ever-indoor tanning, burns from indoor tanning, and MC1R (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.81). Our early-onset BCC risk prediction model incorporating MC1R and indoor tanning extends the work of other skin cancer risk prediction models, emphasizes the value of both genotype and indoor tanning in skin cancer risk prediction in young people, and should be validated with an independent cohort.",

        abstract: "Genetic variation at the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is an important risk factor for developing ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced skin cancer, the most common form of cancer in humans. The underlying mechanisms by which the MC1R defends against UV-induced skin cancer are not known. We used neonatal mouse skin (which, like human skin, contains a mixture of melanocytes and keratinocytes) to study how pigment cells and Mc1r genotype affect the genome-level response to UV radiation. Animals without viable melanocytes (Kit(W-v)/Kit(W-v)) or animals lacking a functional Mc1r (Mc1r(e)/Mc1r(e)) were exposed to sunburn-level doses of UVB radiation, and the patterns of large-scale gene expression in the basal epidermis were compared to each other and to nonmutant animals. Our analysis revealed discrete Kit- and Mc1r-dependent UVB transcriptional responses in the basal epidermis. The Kit-dependent UVB response was characterized largely by an enrichment of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress genes, highlighting a distinctive role for pigmented melanocytes in mediating antioxidant defenses against genotoxic stresses within the basal epidermal environment. By contrast, the Mc1r-dependent UVB response contained an abundance of genes associated with regulating the cell cycle and oncogenesis. To test the clinical relevance of these observations, we analyzed publicly available data sets for primary melanoma and melanoma metastases and found that the set of genes specific for the Mc1r-dependent UVB response was able to differentiate between different clinical subtypes. Our analysis also revealed that the classes of genes induced by UVB differ from those repressed by UVB with regard to their biological functions, their overall number, and their size. The findings described here offer new insights into the transcriptional nature of the UV response in the skin and provide a molecular framework for the underlying mechanisms by which melanocytes and the Mc1r independently mediate and afford protection against UV radiation.",

        abstract: "The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) mediates the tanning response through induction of cAMP and downstream pigmentary enzymes. Diminished function alleles of MC1R are associated with decreased tanning and increased melanoma risk, which has been attributed to increased rates of mutation. We have found that MC1R or cAMP signaling also directly decreases proliferation in melanoma cell lines. MC1R overexpression, treatment with the MC1R ligand, or treatment with small-molecule activators of cAMP signaling causes delayed progression from G2 into mitosis. This delay is caused by phosphorylation and inhibition of cdc25B, a cyclin dependent kinase 1-activating phosphatase, and is rescued by expression of a cdc25B mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at the serine 323 residue. These results show that MC1R and cAMP signaling can directly inhibit melanoma growth through regulation of the G2/M checkpoint.",

        abstract: "Melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) and agouti signaling protein (ASIP) play pivotal roles in the regulation of human pigmentation. We aimed to study whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MC1R and ASIP genes contribute to the pathogenesis of the polygenic pigment skin disorder, vitiligo. The PCR-amplified, full-length MC1R gene was studied with sequence analysis, and the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) SNP of ASIP was detected using restriction fragment length polymorphism. The allele frequency of the ASIP SNP did not show any difference between the skin type, hair color and eye color-matched 97 vitiligo patients and the 59 healthy control individuals. As one of the MC1R polymorphisms showed significantly higher incidence among fair-skinned individuals (Fitzpatrick I+II, n=140) than among dark-skinned individuals (Fitzpatrick III+IV, n=90), both vitiligo patients and controls were divided into two groups and the frequency of the MC1R alleles was studied separately in fair-skinned and dark-skinned subgroups of diseased and healthy groups. C478T, one of the MC1R SNPs studied in 108 fair-skinned vitiligo patients and in 70 fair-skinned healthy control individuals, showed a significant difference (P=0.0262, odds ratio [95% confidence interval]=3.6 [0.0046-0.1003]) in allele frequency between the two groups: the allele frequency was higher in the control group, suggesting protection against vitiligo. Computer prediction of antigenicity has revealed that the Arg160Trp amino acid change caused by this SNP results in a decrease in antigenicity of the affected peptide epitope.",

        abstract: "Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic loci associated with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) risk, but single-nucleotide polymorphism associations with cSCC invasiveness have not been investigated. We examined associations between cSCC invasiveness and 23 reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms among 67,833 non-Hispanic white subjects. Additionally, we performed a genome-wide scan and identified one SNP with significantly different frequencies in 5,724 subjects with at least one invasive tumor and 1,943 subjects with in situ tumors only. We then compared genotype frequencies among the invasive and in situ groups with those of 60,166 control subjects. The genome-wide scan identified that the T allele in single-nucleotide polymorphism rs41269979 in the class II human leukocyte antigen region was more frequent in the invasive than the in situ group (P = 4.93 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in five of the 23 previously associated loci showed odds ratio heterogeneity between the in situ and invasive groups: rs447510 in HLA-DQA1 (P<sub>het</sub> = 2.93 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), rs12203592 in IRF4 (P<sub>het</sub> = 3.94 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), rs1805007 in MC1R (P<sub>het</sub> = 7.71 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), and two SNPs in DEF8 (rs4268748, P<sub>het</sub> = 1.09 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and rs8063761, P<sub>het</sub> = 1.40 × 10<sup>-4</sup>).

        abstract: "The melanocortin system in the skin coordinates pigmentation and immune response and could be implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. We aimed to analyze changes in expression of genes involved in skin pigmentation (melanocortin system and enzymes involved in melanin synthesis). With quantitative RT-PCR we measured the mRNA expression levels of eight genes from the melanocortin system and two enzymes involved in melanogenesis. RNA was extracted from both lesional and non-lesional skin of vitiligo patients and in non-sun-exposed skin of healthy subjects. POMC (proopiomelanocortin) expression was lower in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin. Expression of melanocortin receptors was increased in unaffected skin of vitiligo patients compared to healthy subjects and decreased in lesional skin compared to uninvolved skin of vitiligo patients, the differences were statistically significant in the cases of MC1R (melanocortin receptor 1) and MC4R (melanocortin receptor 4). TRP1 and DCT genes were down-regulated in lesional skin compared to non-lesional vitiligo skin or skin of healthy controls and up-regulated in uninvolved vitiligo skin compared to healthy control samples. In non-lesional skin, POMC expression was not elevated, possibly indicating that systemic influences are involved in up-regulation of MC receptor genes. Decreased expression of the analyzed genes in the lesional skin is not surprising, but statistically significant increased expression of studied genes in non-lesional skin from vitiligo patients is not described previously. In our mind, up-regulation of melanocortin system in non-lesional skin could be systemic compensation to restore normal pigmentation in lesions.",

Overall, 1,046 Caucasian individuals were included in the study. A thousand of them were genotyped for MC1R variants: 509 were sporadic MM patients and 491 were healthy control subjects from general population. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, hair colour, eye colour, skin phototype and ancestry. We found that carriers of the R151C and R163Q variants were at an increased risk for melanoma OR 2.76 (1.59-4.78) and OR 5.62 (2.54-12.42), respectively. The risk of carrying RHC variants was 3.04 (1.90-4.86). Current study confirms the increased MM risk for R151C carriers. It also supports the association between R163Q variant and MM risk in the population on the Canary Islands, as opposed to reported on northern populations.

        abstract: "Cutaneous pigmentation is determined by the amounts of eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesized by epidermal melanocytes and is known to protect against sun-induced DNA damage. The synthesis of eumelanin is stimulated by the binding of alpha-melanotropin (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) to the functional melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) expressed on melanocytes. The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic and certain allelic variants of the gene are associated with red hair phenotype, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The importance of the MC1R gene in determining skin cancer risk led us to examine the impact of specific polymorphisms in this gene on the responses of human melanocytes to alpha-melanotropin and UV radiation. We compared the ability of human melanocyte cultures, each derived from a single donor, to respond to alpha-melanotropin with dose-dependent stimulation of cAMP formation, tyrosinase activity and proliferation. In each of those cultures the MC1R gene was sequenced, and the eumelanin and pheomelanin contents were determined. Human melanocytes homozygous for Arg160Trp, heterozygous for Arg160Trp and Asp294His, or for Arg151Cys and Asp294His substitutions, but not melanocytes homozygous for Val92Met substitution, in the MC1R demonstrated a significantly reduced response to alpha-melanotropin. Additionally, melanocytes with a non-functional MC1R demonstrated a pronounced increase in their sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of UV radiation compared with melanocytes expressing functional MC1R. We conclude that loss-of-function mutations in the MC1R gene sensitize human melanocytes to the DNA damaging effects of UV radiation, which may increase skin cancer risk.",

For example, damage from UVB irradiation manifests itself in the form of sunburn cells and enhancement of the expression of p53, while damage from UVA exposure results in an increase in the expression of vimentin. These reactions to UV irradiation were used in this work to evaluate the photoprotective capacities of two sunblock preparations that were applied to the surface of the skin. One sunblock preparation is a UVB absorber containing zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium oxide (TiO2) exclusively. The other sunblock preparation is a new organo-mineral sunblock containing Tinosorb M, OCM, ZnO and TiO2. Evaluation of the photoprotective capacities of both preparations on hairless rat skin and on in vitro reconstructed human epidermis revealed that they were effective in preventing UVB-induced damage. In contrast, only the organo-mineral sunblock was effective in the prevention of UVA-specific damage such as dermal alterations characterized by the expression of vimentin. Furthermore, our data support the fact that hairless rat skin and in vitro reconstructed human epidermis are a reliable basis for the evaluation of the photoprotective capacities of various sunscreens against UVB and UVA damage.",

        abstract: "Human biomonitoring (HBM) has become a crucial tool for assessing exposure to emerging chemicals. We analyzed 250 24-h urine samples from the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB), collected between 2000 and 2021, for exposure to diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (DHHB), a UV filter increasingly used in sunscreens. Three major metabolites were examined: 2-(4-diethylamino)-, 2-(4-ethylamino)-, and 2-(4-amino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid (DHB, EHB, AHB), with detection rates of 18°%, 13°%, and 87°%, respectively. While EHB and DHB were specific to DHHB, AHB suggested other exposure sources, making it unreliable for assessing DHHB exposure. DHB and EHB were first detected in 2012, with increased detection rates thereafter. The median daily intake of 37 ng/kg bw/d was much lower than the derived no-effect level of 2900 mg/kg bw/d, indicating low risk from DHHB exposure. However, since the analyzed ESB samples were collected in winter, they likely reflect exposure from other products and the environment rather than sunscreen-related exposure. Recently, concerns have emerged regarding the DHHB impurity di-n-hexylphthalate (DnHexP), a reproductive toxicant not authorized in the EU. Retrospective analysis of oral DHHB dosing experiments indeed revealed impurity related dose-dependent excretion of DnHexP metabolites (MnHexP, oxidized 5-OH-MnHexP, and 5-oxo-MnHexP). Due to uncertainties in dose allocation, only a rough excretion fraction of 45°% for MnHexP was derived. Our findings suggest that the DHHB impurity DnHexP may contribute to DnHexP exposure in sunscreen users applying products with contaminated DHHB. Given DnHexP's toxicity, this warrants re-assessment of DHHB's safety in cosmetics and enhanced surveillance of both DHHB and DnHexP in HBM studies.",

        abstract: "Human skin is the first line of photoprotection against UV radiation. However, despite having its defence mechanisms, the photoprotection that the skin exerts is not enough. To protect human skin, the inclusion of UV filters in the cosmetic industry has grown significantly as a photoprotection strategy. Octylmethoxycinnamate, also designated by octinoxate, or 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (CAS number: 5466-77-3) is one of the most widely used UV-B filter in the cosmetic industry. The toxic effects of OMC have alarmed the public, but there is still no consensus in the scientific community about its use. This article aims to provide an overview of the UV filters' photoprotection, emphasizing the OMC and the possible negative effects it may have on the public health. Moreover, the current legislation will be addressed. In summary, the recommendations should be rethought to assess their risk-benefit, since the existing literature warns us to endocrine-disrupting effects of OMC. Further studies should be focus on the toxicity of OMC alone, in mixture and should consider its degradation products, to improve the knowledge of its risk assessment as EDC.",

        abstract: "Hawaii will ban two major ingredients of sunscreens. This article reviews the reasons and future directions. Hawaii recently enacted legislation that will ban the use of two major ingredients of the majority of commonly used sunscreens. The reason for the ban is the ingredients' putative deleterious impact on marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. But sunscreens also save lives by decreasing the risk of UV-induced skin cancers. We review both sides of the issue and potential implications for the healthcare system. Coral reefs consist of organisms in delicate equilibria that are susceptible to small changes in their surroundings. Recent natural and man-made disruptions, direct or indirect, such as changes in ocean temperature and chemistry, ingress of invasive species, pathogens, pollution and deleterious fishing practices, have been blamed for the poor health, or even the outright destruction, of some coral reefs. The most popular sunscreen products contain two ingredients-oxybenzone and octinoxate-that have also been implicated in coral toxicity and will be banned. This creates a healthcare dilemma: Will the protection of coral reefs result in an increase in human skin cancers? Concentration estimates and mechanism studies support an association-direct or indirect (via promotion of viral infection)-of sunscreens with bleaching of coral reefs. A ban on the two most common sunscreen ingredients goes into effect in Hawaii on January 1, 2021. Proponents suggest that this is a trend, just the first of many such bans worldwide; opponents warn of a dire increase in human skin cancers. As a result, alternative sunscreen compounds are being sought.",

        abstract: "Organic ultraviolet filter chemicals (UVFCs) are the active ingredients used in many sunscreens to protect the skin from UV light; these chemicals have been detected in numerous aquatic environments leading to concerns about how they might affect aquatic organisms and humans. One commonly used organic UVFC is octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), better known by its commercial name, octinoxate. Upon exposure to UV light, OMC degrades rapidly, forming numerous photoproducts, some of which have been previously identified. In this study, we isolated and completely characterized the major products of OMC photolysis, including the two major stable OMC cyclodimers. One of these cyclodimers is a δ-truxinate, resulting from a head-to-head dimerization of two OMC molecules, and the other cyclodimer is an α-truxillate, resulting from a head-to-tail dimerization of two OMC molecules. Additionally, the cellular toxicities of the individual photoproducts were determined; it was found that the parent UVFC, OMC, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, and two cyclodimers are significantly toxic to cells. The photoproduct 2-ethylhexanol is not cytotoxic, demonstrating that different components of OMC photolysate contribute differently to its cellular toxicity. This study thus provides an enhanced understanding of OMC photolysis and gives toxicity data that can be used to better evaluate OMC as a sunscreen agent.",

        abstract: "Ultraviolet (UV) filters are of great concern due to their wide occurrence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Little is known about human exposure to UV filters. A total of 3467 individual human milk samples from 24 Chinese provinces were collected during 2017-2019. The concentrations of 12 UV filters in 100 pooled milk samples were determined. The total UV filter concentration was 78-846 (mean 235 ± 120) ng/g lipid weight. The highest and lowest total mean concentrations were for samples from Qinghai and Sichuan provinces, respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between UV radiation levels and UV concentrations in the samples. The dominant UV filters were 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl) benzotriazole (UV-P) and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), which contributed means of 32 and 22%, respectively, to the total concentrations. Plastic products and sunscreens were probably the sources of UV-P and EHMC in the human milk from China, respectively. The mean 2-(3,5-di-<i>tert</i>-amyl-2-hydroxyphenyl) benzotriazole (UV-328) concentration was 2.6 ± 2.6 ng/g lipid weight. The UV filter profiles were similar to profiles for samples from Japan, the Philippines, and Switzerland but not for samples from Korea and Vietnam. The estimated daily UV filter intake for breastfed infants was below the corresponding reference dose. This was the first large-scale study of UV filters in human milk and will help assess the risks posed.",

        abstract: "Sunscreen products are composed of ultraviolet (UV) filters and formulated to reduce exposure to sunlight thereby lessening skin damage. Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity and potential endocrine disrupting (ED) effects of UV filters. The ToxCast/Tox21 program, that is, CompTox, is a high-throughput in vitro screening database of chemicals that identify adverse outcome pathways, key events, and ED potential of chemicals. Using the ToxCast/Tox21 database, octisalate, homosalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and avobenzone, 6 commonly used organic UV filters, were found to have been evaluated. These UV filters showed low potency in these bioassays with most activity detected above the range of the cytotoxic burst. The pathways that were most affected were the cell cycle and the nuclear receptor pathways. Most activity was observed in liver and kidney-based bioassays. These organic filters and their metabolites showed relatively weak ED activity when tested in bioassays measuring estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), thyroid receptor, and steroidogenesis activity. Except for oxybenzone, all activity in the endocrine assays occurred at concentrations greater than the cytotoxic burst. Moreover, except for oxybenzone, plasma concentrations (Cmax) measured in humans were at least 100× lower than bioactive (AC50/ACC) concentrations that produced a response in ToxCast/Tox21 assays. These data are consistent with in vivo animal/human studies showing weak or negligible endocrine activity. In sum, when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence assessment and compared with measured plasma concentrations, the results show these organic UV filters have low intrinsic biological activity and risk of toxicity including endocrine disruption in humans.",

        abstract: "The validated OECD test guideline 456 based on human adrenal H295R cells promotes measurement of testosterone and estradiol production as read-out to identify potential endocrine disrupting chemicals. This study aimed to establish optimal conditions for using H295R cells to detect chemicals interfering with the production of key adrenal steroids. H295R cells' supernatants were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based steroid profiling, and the influence of experimental conditions including time and serum content was assessed. Steroid profiles were determined before and after incubation with reference compounds and chemicals to be tested for potential disruption of adrenal steroidogenesis. The H295R cells cultivated according to the OECD test guideline produced progestins, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens but only very low amounts of testosterone. However, testosterone contained in Nu-serum was metabolized during the 48h incubation. Thus, inclusion of positive and negative controls and a steroid profile of the complete medium prior to the experiment (t=0h) was necessary to characterize H295R cells' steroid production and indicate alterations caused by exposure to chemicals. Among the tested chemicals, octyl methoxycinnamate and acetyl tributylcitrate resembled the corticosteroid induction pattern of the positive control torcetrapib. Gene expression analysis revealed that octyl methoxycinnamate and acetyl tributylcitrate enhanced CYP11B2 expression, although less pronounced than torcetrapib. Further experiments need to assess the toxicological relevance of octyl methoxycinnamate- and acetyl tributylcitrate-induced corticosteroid production. In conclusion, the extended profiling and appropriate controls allow detecting chemicals that act on steroidogenesis and provide initial mechanistic evidence for prioritizing chemicals for further investigations.",

        title: "Mode of action approach supports a lack of carcinogenic potential of six organic UV filters.",
        abstract: "Ultraviolet (UV) filters, the active ingredients in sunscreens, have been used for several decades to reduce the risk of acute and chronic damage to the skin from solar UV radiation, which can lead to skin cancer. Based on recent clinical studies showing that certain UV filters are absorbed systemically at low levels in humans, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested supplementing existing safety data with preclinical studies including oral and dermal 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies. Although the conduct of 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies has been the standard approach for evaluating the carcinogenic potential of chemicals and new drugs for approximately 6 decades, there are multiple examples showing that such studies are not predictive of human cancer risk. Given these concerns with 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies, we have developed and applied an alternative approach for supplementing existing data related to carcinogenic potential for six of the most commonly used UV filters in sunscreen products (i.e. avobenzone, ensulizole, homosalate, octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene). This approach evaluates their mode of action (MOA) based on <i>in vivo</i>, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in silico</i> data combined with an assessment of exposure margins. This approach is based on the substantial progress in understanding the MOAs that are responsible for tumor induction in humans. It is consistent with those being developed by the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and other health authorities to replace 2-year carcinogenicity studies given their limitations and questionable biological relevance to humans. The available data for the six UV filters show that they are not genotoxic and show no evidence of biologically relevant carcinogenic MOAs. Furthermore, their systemic exposure levels in humans fall well below concentrations at which they have biologic activity. In conclusion, these data support the continued safe use of these six filters in sunscreen products.",

        title: "Organic ultraviolet filters in nearshore waters and in the invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans) in Grenada, West Indies.",
        abstract: "Sunscreens and other personal care products use organic ultraviolet (UV) filters such as oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate to prevent damage to human skin. While these compounds are effective at preventing sunburn, they have a demonstrated negative effect on cells and tissues across taxonomic levels. These compounds have a relatively short half-life in seawater but are continuously re-introduced via recreational activities and wastewater discharge, making them environmentally persistent. Because of this, testing seawater samples for the presence of these compounds may not be reflective of their abundance in the environment. Bioaccumulation of organic ultraviolet filters in a high-trophic level predator may provide greater insight to the presence and persistence of these compounds. To address this, the present study collected seawater samples as well as muscle and stomach content samples from the invasive Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) in the nearshore waters of Grenada, West Indies to examine the use of lionfish as potential bioindicator species. Seawater and lionfish samples were collected at four sites that are near point sources of wastewater discharge and that receive a high number of visitors each year. Samples were tested for the presence and concentrations of oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Oxybenzone residues were detected in 60% of seawater samples and OMC residues were detected in 20% of seawater samples. Seawater samples collected in the surface waters near Grenada's main beach had oxybenzone concentrations more than ten times higher than seawater samples collected in less frequently visited areas and the highest prevalence of UV filters in lionfish. Residues of oxybenzone were detected in 35% of lionfish muscle and 4-MBC residues were detected in 12% of lionfish muscle. Padimate-O was not detected in either seawater or lionfish samples. No organic UV filters were detected in lionfish stomach contents. Histopathologic examination of lionfish demonstrated no significant findings attributed to UV filter toxicity. These findings report UV filter residue levels for the first time in inshore waters in Grenada. Results indicate that lionfish may be bioaccumulating residues and may be a useful sentinel model for monitoring organic ultraviolet filters in the Caribbean Sea.",

        abstract: "A new sunscreen ingredient, methoxycinnamidopropyl polysilsesquioxane (MCP-PSQ), which contains an UV-absorbing p-methoxycinnamoyl group, has been developed synthetically and evaluated using in vitro and in vivo approaches. Previous studies revealed that MCP-PSQ has a raising or boosting effect on the sun protection factor (SPF) of other sunscreen agents. In this study, we demonstrated that MCP-PSQ, an organic/inorganic hybrid compound, has photoprotective effects for human fibroblasts, and for hairless mouse and human skin. MCP-PSQ increases cell viability and suppresses the expression of p53 protein in fibroblasts after UV exposure. In addition, the numbers of sunburn cells and mast cells are reduced by topical application of MCP-PSQ on hairless mouse skin after UV irradiation. A 10% MCP-PSQ cream has higher and similar effects on SPF values for human skin compared to 5% titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and 5% ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), respectively. The SPF value obtained using the MCP-PSQ cream did not drop after UV irradiation of the cream itself. However, higher dose of UV irradiation is required to guarantee the stability or photostability of the formulation. Further, there were no side effects such as erythema, edema, itch or tingling, suggesting that MCP-PSQ is a good sunscreen agent.",

        abstract: "The use of sunscreen products is widely promoted by schools, government agencies, and health-related organizations to minimize sunburn and skin damage. In this study, we developed stable solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) containing the chemical UV filter octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC). In parallel, we produced similar stable SLNs in which 20% of the OMC content was replaced by the botanical urucum oil. When these SLNs were applied to the skin of human volunteers, no changes in fluorescence lifetimes or redox ratios of the endogenous skin fluorophores were seen, suggesting that the formulations did not induce toxic responses in the skin. Ex vivo (skin diffusion) tests showed no significant penetration. In vitro studies showed that when 20% of the OMC was replaced by urucum oil, there was no reduction in skin protection factor (SPF), suggesting that a decrease in the amount of chemical filter may be a viable alternative for an effective sunscreen, in combination with an antioxidant-rich vegetable oil, such as urucum. There is a strong trend towards increasing safety of sun protection products through reduction in the use of chemical UV filters. This work supports this approach by producing formulations with lower concentrations of OMC, while maintaining the SPF. Further investigations of SPF in vivo are needed to assess the suitability of these formulations for human use.",

        abstract: "Throughout human life, an extensive and varied range of emerging environmental contaminants, called endocrine disruptors (EDCs), cause adverse health effects, including in the cardiovascular (CV) system. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are worryingly one of the leading causes of all mortality and mobility worldwide. The UV-B filter octylmethoxycinnamate (also designated octinoxate, or ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (CAS number: 5466-77-3)) is an EDC widely present in all personal care products. However, to date, there are no studies evaluating the OMC-induced effects on vasculature using animal models to improve human cardiovascular health. This work analysed the effects of OMC on rat aorta vasculature and explored the modes of action implicated in these effects. Our results indicated that OMC relaxes the rat aorta by endothelium-dependent mechanisms through the signaling pathways of cyclic nucleotides and by endothelium-independent mechanisms involving inhibition of L-Type voltage-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (L-Type VOCC). Overall, OMC toxicity on rat aorta may produce hypotension via vasodilation due to excessive NO release and blockade of L-Type VOCC. Moreover, the OMC-induced endothelial dysfunction may also occur by promoting the endothelial release of endothelin-1. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that exposure to OMC alters the reactivity of the rat aorta and highlight that long-term OMC exposure may increase the risk of human CV diseases.",

        abstract: "In recent years, concerns regarding the toxicity of organic UV filters in sunscreen products have increased. While sunscreen products contain multiple UV filters in combination, current understanding on their co-occurrence patterns and mixture toxicities is still limited. This study utilized a public database, \"Hwahae\", and analyzed 2183 sunscreen products marketed in South Korea as of 2019, using an association rule mining (ARM) to elucidate their co-occurrence patterns. We identified twenty-two UV filters in the sunscreen products, with titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) being the most prevalent (68 %), followed by ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC, 60 %) and ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS, 49 %). Sunscreen products typically contained a median of five UV filters per product. Usage patterns of UV filter mixtures varied by the target user group of the product, i.e., general, susceptible, and male users. EHMC and EHS were commonly combined in most products, except those marketed for susceptible users. For susceptible users, inorganic UV filters such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and zinc oxide (ZnO) were dominantly used. Combinations of UV filters that provide protection against different types of UV light, e.g., butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM) for UVA, and octocrylene (OCT), EHS, or homosalate (HS) for UVB, were also frequently used together, with high lift values. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that ARM approach can be useful to identify major combinations of UV filters present in sunscreen products, and prioritize the UV filter combinations requiring safety assessment and regulatory attention.",

        abstract: "We present a case study that provides a practical step-by-step example of how the internal Threshold of Toxicological Concern (iTTC) can be used as a tool to refine a TTC-based assessment for dermal exposures to consumer products. The case study uses a theoretical scenario where there are no systemic toxicity data for the case study chemicals (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, octinoxate, and ecamsule). Human dermal pharmacokinetic data following single and repeat dermal exposure to products containing the case study chemicals were obtained from data published by the US FDA. The clinical studies utilized an application procedure that followed maximal use conditions (product applied as 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 75% of the body surface area, 4 times a day). The case study chemicals were first reviewed to determine if they were in the applicability domain of the iTTC, and then, the human plasma concentrations were compared to an iTTC limit of 1 µM. When assessed under maximum usage, the external exposure of all chemicals exceeded the external dose TTC limits. By contrast, the internal exposure to all chemicals, except oxybenzone, was an order of magnitude lower than the 1 µM interim iTTC threshold. This work highlights the importance of understanding internal exposure relative to external dose and how the iTTC can be a valuable tool for assessing low-level internal exposures; additionally, the work demonstrates how to use an iTTC, and highlights considerations and refinement opportunities for the approach.",

        abstract: "Sunscreen skin penetration and safety assessment should be considered together in order to ensure that in vitro cytotoxicity studies examine relevant doses of these organic chemical UV filters to which viable epidermal cells are realistically exposed. In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient topically applied sunscreens penetrated into human viable epidermis to put the local keratinocyte cell populations at risk of toxicity. The penetration and retention of five commonly used sunscreen agents (avobenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, oxybenzone and padimate O) in human skin was evaluated after application in mineral oil to isolated human epidermal membranes. Sunscreen concentration-human keratinocyte culture response curves were then defined using changes in cell morphology and proliferation (DNA synthesis using radiolabelled thymidine uptake studies) as evidence of sunscreens causing toxicity. Following 24 h of human epidermal exposure to sunscreens, detectable amounts of all sunscreens were present in the stratum corneum and viable epidermis, with epidermal penetration most evident with oxybenzone. The concentrations of each sunscreen found in human viable epidermis after topical application, adjusting for skin partitioning and binding effects, were at least 5-fold lower, based on levels detected in viable epidermal cells, than those appearing to cause toxicity in cultured human keratinocytes. It is concluded that the human viable epidermal levels of sunscreens are too low to cause any significant toxicity to the underlying human keratinocytes.",

        abstract: "Sunscreens prevent sunburn and may also prevent skin cancer by protecting from ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. We assessed the ability of two sunscreens, with different spectral profiles, to inhibit DNA photodamage in human epidermis in situ. One formulation contained the established ultraviolet B filter octyl methoxycinnamate, whereas the other contained terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid, a new ultraviolet A filter. Both formulations had sun protection factors of 4 when assessed with solar simulating radiation in volunteers of skin type I/II. We tested the hypothesis that sun protection factors would indicate the level of protection against DNA photodamage. Thus, we exposed sunscreen-treated sites to four times the minimal erythema dose of solar simulating radiation, whereas vehicle and control sites were exposed to one minimal erythema dose. We used monoclonal antibodies against thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts and image analysis to quantify DNA damage in skin sections. A dose of four times the minimal erythema dose, with either sunscreen, resulted in comparable levels of thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts to one minimal erythema dose +/- vehicle, providing evidence that the DNA protection factor is comparable to the sun protection factor. The lack of difference between the sunscreens indicates similar action spectra for erythema and DNA photodamage and that erythema is a clinical surrogate for DNA photodamage that may lead to skin cancer.",

        abstract: "Avobenzone and homosalate are widely used in sunscreens to provide ultraviolet (UV) protection, either as single compounds or in combination. Some UV filters exhibit estrogenic or anti-androgenic activities, however, studies regarding their interactions and toxicity in mixtures are limited. In this study, the effect of the toxicity of a binary mixture comprising avobenzone (0.72 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) and homosalate (1.02 and 103 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) on steroid hormone biosynthesis were investigated using male zebrafish and human adrenocortical carcinoma (H295R) cells. In fish exposed to homosalate, a significant decrease in the gonadosomatic index, testosterone level, and transcription of several genes (e.g, hsd3b2, cyp17a1, and hsd17b1) and a significant increase in the hepatosomatic index, liver steatosis, 17β-estradiol level, and transcription of vtg gene were observed. These results suggest that estrogenic and anti-androgenic effects of homosalate were mediated by the steroidogenic pathway. The presence of 0.72 μg L<sup>-1</sup> of avobenzone augmented the anti-androgenic responses in male fish. The testosterone level in the H295R cells were significantly decreased after they were exposed to homosalate alone or in combination with avobenzone, which is consistent with observations in male zebrafish. Further studies need to be conducted to understand the endocrine disrupting properties of long-term exposure to substances typically used in sunscreens.",

Benzophenone type of UV filters react under disinfection conditions with chlorine and form different mono- and dichlorinated products, while dibenzoylmethane derivatives, such as avobenzone, react with chlorine and form two main bridge chlorinated products followed by numerous chlorinated species at the advanced stages of the process. Resveratrol showed three main susceptible centers to chlorination, starting from the electrophilic addition to the double bond and continuing with the chlorination of the phenolic moieties. Several experiments conducted under different disinfection conditions (pool/sea water, addition of salts, irradiation) showed basically similar chlorination patters with some variations in terms of product formation. The results of toxicity assessment using different test organisms (Vibrio fischeri, microalgae, daphnids) have shown different sensitivity of testing organisms to the parent UV filters in comparison with chlorinated products as well as different toxicity for specific UV filter in comparison to the others. As the closing loop of all experiments in the laboratory, an up-scaling to the real human skin is presented.",

        abstract: "The increased use of sunscreens and other cosmetics containing UV filters causes human and environmental burden. Avobenzone is a widely used UV filter. In its pure form it is known to undergo several transformations including photo-isomerisation, photodegradation, and halogenation. Over 60 disinfection by-products were identified as transformation products of avobenzone in different disinfection reactions of chlorination and bromination in fresh and seawater. Two occasional samples of swimming pool water demonstrated the presence of some of these by-products at noticeable levels as judged by GC-MS peak areas. Although the toxicity of the majority of these products remain unknown, chlorinated phenols and acetophenones are known to be rather toxic. Aquatic bromination of avobenzone resulted in the identification of 33 disinfection by-products (DBPs). Many of them contain bromine in the molecular structure. Addition of copper salt slightly decreases conversion rate simultaneously increasing the levels of major brominated products. Photostability of 3 commercial sunscreen products (solar protection factor 30) containing avobenzone was studied under different experimental conditions including UVA/UVB, UVC photostimulation and chlorination. The commercial sunscreen products have completely different enhancing and inhibitory effect on avobenzone degradation under UVC light. The complex composition of commercial products caused also a protective shield in case of chlorinated solutions of commercial formulations exposed to chlorine and UVA/UVB light at the same time.",

        title: "Systemic availability of lipophilic organic UV filters through dermal sunscreen exposure.",
        abstract: "Chemical UV filters are common components in sunscreens and cosmetic products and used to protect the skin against harmful effects of sunlight like sunburn. However, the effectiveness of sunscreens in the prevention of skin cancer is in some parts still controversial. Meanwhile, questions about negative effects of the chemical UV filters on human health arise and request an effective risk assessment. Real-life exposure data in humans after application of these products are still rare. Thus, we explored whether and to what extent UV filters are absorbed through the skin into the human body. Plasma and urine samples from 20 healthy volunteers were collected before, during and after a real-life exposure scenario (1st application: 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>; 2nd and 3rd (after 2 and 4 h): 1 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> each) using a commercial sunscreen formulation for one day. These samples were analyzed for their content of the currently prominent UV filters octocrylene and avobenzone as well as 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylic acid (CDAA) as the main octocrylene metabolite by using different liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometric procedures. Following dermal sunscreen exposure, avobenzone, octocrylene and CDAA reached concentrations up to 11 μg/L, 25 μg/L and 1352 μg/L in plasma. In urine detection rates of avobenzone and octocrylene were low while CDAA showed a high detection rate and reached up to 5207 μg/g creatinine. Kinetic models could be fitted for octocrylene and CDAA in plasma and CDAA in urine. Concentration peaks were reached between 10 and 16 h after first application and half-life periods were in the range of 1.5 to 2 days. The lipophilic UV filter octocrylene and its metabolite CDAA showed a much slower elimination than other more hydrophilic UV filters. Concordantly, the metabolite CDAA in particular showed a markedly increased renal excretion over the whole sampling period and indicated high internal exposure to OC. Real-life sunscreen usage leads to considerable bioavailability of organic UV filters and their metabolites which is rarely seen for other environmental exposures. A combined monitoring of the parent compound and its metabolites is important to fully address internal exposure to the UV filter in humans. Considering the kinetic profiles a prolonged systemic release due to depot formation in skin and a potential accumulation through multi-day exposure is presumed. High in-vivo loads call for a critical toxicological assessment of the UV filters and their metabolites.",

        title: "Adverse Effects of Avobenzone on Boar Sperm Function: Disruption of Protein Kinase A Activity and Tyrosine Phosphorylation.",
        abstract: "Avobenzone (AVO), an ultraviolet (UV) filter, is frequently used as an ingredient in personal cosmetics. This UV filter has been found to be easily exposed in swimming pools and beaches, and it has been detected in human urine and blood. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated that AVO exhibits endocrine-disrupting properties. Nevertheless, the effects of AVO on male fertility have not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of AVO on various sperm functions during capacitation. First, boar spermatozoa were treated with various AVO concentrations. After treatment, sperm motility and kinetic characteristics, capacitation status, intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and sperm viability were evaluated. Moreover, Western blot analysis w.as conducted to evaluate protein kinase A (PKA) activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. As a result, AVO treatment significantly decreased total motility, progressive motility, and several kinetic characteristics at high concentrations (50 and 100 μM). Furthermore, the capacitation status dose-dependently decreased. Conversely, no significant differences in acrosome reaction, cell viability, and intracellular ATP levels were observed. However, the intracellular ATP level tended to decrease. In addition, AVO dose-dependently induced abnormal changes in PKA activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. Although AVO did not directly exert a toxic effect on cell viability, it ultimately negatively affected sperm functions through abnormal alterations in PKA activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, the potential implications on male fertility must be considered when contemplating the safe utilization of AVO.",

        abstract: "In vitro three-dimensional human skin models are an innovative alternative to evaluate cytotoxicity and phototoxicity in the cosmetic industry. The aim of this study was to use a skin model to evaluate the potential toxicity of sunscreen formulations with or without exposure to UV radiation. In addition, the toxicity of these formulations was evaluated after exposure to photodegradation. The results showed toxicity with all formulations/conditions tested, including the control formulation, compared to PBS. Cell viability of photodegraded formulations - prior to the phototoxicity radiation process - was higher, indicating that some formulation components were degraded into products with reduced toxicity. The results also indicated that avobenzone was more unstable/toxic than octyl p-methoxycinnamate under the same test conditions. The sunscreens and their formulations were shown to be toxic to skin model cells to some extent, even when not exposed to UV irradiation; however the biological role of this toxicity is unclear. This result shows the importance of testing sunscreen formulations in real in-use conditions. Finally, since we used an in vitro assay based on a human cell model, this non-invasive technique represents a suitable alternative to animal models for phototoxicity tests in general and could have application in screening new sunscreen products.",

        abstract: "There is growing concern about the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in cosmetics. We aimed to identify the main cosmetic ingredients with suspected endocrine-disrupting properties, and analyse their presence in current marketed products. Particular attention was given to products intended for susceptible (due to physiological status) and vulnerable (due to specific pathologies) groups with a view to informing cosmetologists and related health professionals of the scientific basis and current status of any concerns. Suspected EDCs used as cosmetic ingredients, included in lists published by regulatory agencies, were documented and investigated by weight of evidence analysis based on endocrine-related toxicity studies. In total, 49 suspected EDCs were identified from a sample of over a thousand cosmetic products marketed in the European Union. Suspected EDCs were found in approximately one third of products, with a similar frequency in products intended for susceptible and vulnerable groups. Avobenzone (CAS number:70356-09-1), octisalate (CAS number: 118-60-5), and butylated hydroxytoluene (CAS number: 128-37-0) were mostly commonly identified. The presence of EDCs was particularly high for sun care cosmetic products. Our results highlight potentially significant exposure through cosmetics to substances currently studied by regulatory institutions as suspected endocrine disrupters. EDCs are not yet universally regulated, and informing health professionals and educating the population as a precaution are options to reduce individual exposure levels, especially in vulnerable and susceptible groups. Special recommendations are needed for products intended for oncological patients.",

        title: "Dermatological and environmental toxicological impact of the sunscreen ingredient oxybenzone/benzophenone-3.",
        abstract: "Oxybenzone (Benzophenone-3) is an emerging human and environmental contaminant used in sunscreens and personal care products to help minimize the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation. The Center for Disease Control fourth national report on human exposure to environmental chemicals demonstrated that approximately 97% of the people tested have oxybenzone present in their urine, and independent scientists have reported various concentrations in waterways and fish worldwide. Oxybenzone can also react with chlorine, producing hazardous by-products that can concentrate in swimming pools and wastewater treatment plants. Moreover, adverse reactions could very well be increased by the closed loop of ingesting fish contaminated with oxybenzone and/or washing the ingredient off our bodies and having it return in drinking water as treatment plants do not effectively remove the chemical as part of their processing protocols. In humans, oxybenzone has been reported to produce contact and photocontact allergy reactions, implemented as a possible endocrine disruptor and has been linked to Hirschsprung's disease. Environmentally, oxybenzone has been shown to produce a variety of toxic reactions in coral and fish ranging from reef bleaching to mortality. Lastly, with the rise in skin cancer rates and the availability of more effective sunscreen actives such as micronized zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, serious doubts about the relative prevention benefit of personal care products containing oxybenzone must be raised and compared with the potential negative health and environmental effects caused by the accumulation of this and other chemicals in the ecosystem.",

        title: "Benzophenone-3: Comprehensive review of the toxicological and human evidence with meta-analysis of human biomonitoring studies.",
        abstract: "Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and its major metabolite benzophenone-1 (BP-1) are widely used as UV filters in sunscreens and cosmetics to prevent sunburn and skin damage, or as stabilizers to prevent photodegradation in many commercial products. As a result, their presence is ubiquitous in the environment, wildlife and humans. Based on endocrine disruption concerns, international regulatory agencies are performing a closer evaluation. This work aimed to comprehensively review the available human relevant evidence for safety issues in MEDLINE/PubMed in order to create a structured database of studies, as well as to conduct an integrative analysis as part of the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) Initiative. A total of 1,635 titles and abstracts were screened and 254 references were evaluated and tabulated in detail, and classified in different categories: i) exposure sources and predictors; ii) human biomonitoring (HBM) exposure levels to perform a meta-analysis; iii) toxicokinetic data in both experimental animals and humans; iv) in vitro and in vivo rodent toxicity studies; and v) human data on effect biomarkers and health outcomes. Our integrative analysis showed that internal peak BP-3 concentrations achieved after a single whole-body application of a commercially available sunscreen (4% w/w) may overlap with concentrations eliciting endocrine disrupting effects in vitro, and with internal concentrations causing in vivo adverse female reproductive effects in rodents that were supported by still limited human data. The adverse effects in rodents included prolonged estrous cycle, altered uterine estrogen receptor gene expression, endometrium hyperplasia and altered proliferation and histology of the mammary gland, while human data indicated menstrual cycle hormonal alterations and increased risk of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. Among the modes of action reported (estrogenic, anti-androgenic, thyroid, etc.), BP-3 and especially BP-1 showed estrogenic activity at human-relevant concentrations, in agreement with the observed alterations in female reproductive endpoints. The meta-analysis of HBM studies identified a higher concern for North Americans, showing urinary BP-3 concentrations on average 10 and 20 times higher than European and Asian populations, respectively. Our work supports that these benzophenones present endocrine disrupting properties, endorsing recent European regulatory efforts to limit human exposure. The reproducible and comprehensive database generated may constitute a point of departure in future risk assessments to support regulatory initiatives. Meanwhile, individuals should not refrain from sunscreen use. Commercially available formulations using inorganic UV filters that are practically not absorbed into systemic circulation may be recommended to susceptible populations.",

        abstract: "Cosmetic products contain a wide range of chemicals to which we are exposed every day. The aim of the study was to determine the presence of potential dangerous substances which can cause adverse health effects by examining product labels. A total of 283 products were collected from various shops in Lecce (Italy) and divided into 3 categories: rinse-off, leave-on and make-up. The label of every product was examined and a list including fragrances, preservatives and other chemicals of concern was created. Fragrances were present in 52.3% of the examined products, mostly limonene (76.9%) and linalool (64.6%) but also citronellol (34.1%), geraniol (31.5%), coumarin (30%) and hexyl cinnamal (29.2%). Preservatives showed a rate of 60% and the most frequently identified were phenoxyethanol (48.7%), sodium benzoate (35.6%), potassium sorbate (22%), methylparaben (15.2%) and MI/MCI (9.9%). The other chemicals of concern were detected in 58% of products; included PEGs (62.3%), acrylate copolymer (34%), petrolatum (17.2%), polysorbates (14,8%), BHT (14.7%), ethylhextyl methoxycinnamate (13.6%), benzophenone-1 (3.7%), benzophenone-3 (4.9%), BHA (1.6%), cocamide DEA and toluene (1.2%). The use of many of these substances is allowed within certain limits, due to their toxicity at higher concentrations. Other important aspects should be considered as, for instance, the possibility of long-term effects. On the other hand, other substances may induce several acute adverse side-effects, i.e. contact dermatitis and allergic reactions. For these reasons, an enhancement of the criteria used for cosmetics formulation is required since many chemicals used singularly or combined are potentially unsafe.",

        abstract: "Hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, also known as benzophenone-3 (BP-3), is a commonly used ultraviolet filter in skincare and as a food additive. Large concentrations of similar phenolic compounds have been detected in urine, amniotic fluid, and placental tissue, thereby raising questions about its impact on reproduction. The objective of this paper was to investigate the reproductive toxicity of BP-3 in humans and animals. In humans, studies showed that high levels of BP-3 exposure could be linked to an increase in male birth weight but a decline in female birth weight and male gestational age. In fish, BP-3 exposure resulted in a decline in egg production, hatching, and testosterone, along with a down-regulation of steroidogenic genes. In rats, a decrease in epididymal sperm density and a prolonged estrous cycle for females was observed. These positive associations may be attributed to an altered estrogen and testosterone balance as a result of endocrine disrupting effects of BP-3. However, the current body of literature is limited by non-uniform exposure and outcome measurements in studies both across and within species and future studies will need to be conducted in a standardized fashion to allow for a more significant contribution to the literature that allows for better comparison across studies.",

        abstract: "It has been demonstrated that benzophenone-3 is one of the endocrine-disrupting compounds which are considered as potential risk factors of adverse health effects. However, whether benzophenone-3 exposure can influence the sex steroid hormones levels remains unknown. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which is a cross-sectional dataset, from 2013 to 2016. A total of 1690 male US participants aged 18 or above were included. Urinary benzophenone-3, serum total testosterone, serum estradiol, serum sex hormone-binding globulin were measured. Confounders including age, body mass index, race, education level, urinary creatinine, ratio of family income to poverty, alcohol use, time of venipuncture, cardiac arterial diabetic score, energy intake, bisphenol A, triclosan and total parabens were controlled. After full adjustment (Model III), the upper benzophenone-3 quintiles had odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) of testosterone deficiency of 1.75 (1.03, 2.99), 2.47 (1.53, 3.98), 2.08 (1.13, 3.84) and 1.74 (0.94, 3.23) compared with quintile 1. Compared with quintile 1, percent changes (95 % confidence intervals) in testosterone were - 12 % (-19 %, -5 %) and - 9 % (-17 %, -1 %) for quintile 3 and quintile 5 in Model III. Estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin were generally similar to total testosterone in the associations with benzophenone-3. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that adult men in the US with higher urinary benzophenone-3 had a higher risk of testosterone deficiency and had inverse associations with total testosterone, estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin. To confirm the causal links between benzophenone-3 and sex steroid hormones, prospective studies are needed.",

        abstract: "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with endogenous hormones and are present in many consumer products. In addition, they affect the development and functions of the immune system. The prenatal period is critical, because exposure to EDCs can induce irreversible changes in the immune system and increase susceptibility to asthma and allergies later in life. Nonpersistent EDCs are of most concern owing to their high annual production and potential toxicity. In this review, we summarize the literature on the effects of prenatal exposure to nonpersistent EDCs-phthalates and phenols-on asthma and allergic diseases, describe the underlying biological mechanisms, and make recommendations. Between 2011 and 2020, a total of 19 prospective studies were published. Most of these were focused on phthalates and bisphenol A and few on other bisphenols, parabens, triclosan, and benzophenone-3. Evidence remains insufficient owing to differences in chemical use between countries, sociodemographic characteristics of the study populations, misclassification of exposure due to the high within-subject variability, and heterogeneity in the definition of health outcomes. EDCs can alter airway cell differentiation and gut microbiota, shift the immune response towards TH2, alter expression of T regulatory cells and TH17, and weaken innate immunity. In order to better understand the burden of EDCs on the respiratory and immune systems, we require thoughtfully designed studies to assess exposure, appropriately characterize asthma and allergic phenotypes, and evaluate biological mechanisms and EDC mixtures.",

        abstract: "The age of menarche has been associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disease, as well as cancer risk. The decline in menarcheal age over the past century may be partially attributable to increased exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). We assessed the influence of 26 phenol and phthalate biomarkers on the timing of menarche in a longitudinal cohort of Chilean girls. These EDCs were quantified in urine collected prior to the onset of breast development (Tanner 1; B1), and during adolescence (Tanner 4; B4). Multivariable accelerated failure time (AFT) models were used to analyze associations between biomarker concentrations and the age of menarche adjusting for body mass index (BMI) Z-score and maternal education, accounting for within-subject correlation. Several biomarkers were significantly associated with the age at menarche; however, these associations were dependent on the timing of biomarker assessment. A log(ng/ml) increase in B1 concentrations of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate biomarkers was associated with later menarche (hazard ratio (HR): 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.98), whereas higher B1 concentrations of 2,5-dichlorophenol and benzophenone-3 were associated with earlier menarche (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.27; HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29, respectively). Elevated B4 concentrations of monomethyl phthalate were similarly associated with earlier menarche (HR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.53). The impact of monoethyl phthalate and triclosan concentrations on pubertal timing were significantly modified by BMI Z-score. Higher monoethyl phthalate and triclosan concentrations were associated with earlier menarche among overweight or obese girls, but not among those that were normal weight. This study identifies modulation of sexual maturation by specific EDC biomarkers in Latina girls.",

        abstract: "Ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing chemicals (UV filters) are used in personal care products for the protection of human skin and hair from damage by UV radiation. Although these substances are released into the environment in the production and consumption processes, little is known about their ecotoxicology effects. The acute toxicity and potential ecological risk of UV filters benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and benzophenone-4 (BP-4) on <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>, <i>Daphnia magna</i>, and <i>Brachydanio rerio</i> were analyzed in the present study. The EC<sub>50</sub> values (96 h) of BP-3 and BP-4 on <i>C. vulgaris</i> were 2.98 and 201.00 mg/L, respectively. The 48 h-LC<sub>50</sub> of BP-3 and BP-4 on <i>D. magna</i> were 1.09 and 47.47 mg/L, respectively. The 96 h-LC<sub>50</sub> of BP-3 and BP-4 on <i>B. rerio</i> were 3.89 and 633.00 mg/L, respectively. The toxicity of a mixture of BP-3 and BP-4 on <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>D. magna</i>, and <i>B. rerio</i> all showed antagonistic effects. The induced predicted no-effect concentrations of BP-3 and BP-4 by the assessment factor method were 1.80 × 10<sup>-3</sup> and 0.47 mg/L, respectively, by assessment factor (AF) method, which were both lower than the concentrations detected in the environment at present, verifying that BP-3 and BP-4 remain low-risk chemicals to the aquatic ecosystem.",

        title: "Urinary phenol concentrations and fecundability and early pregnancy loss.",
        abstract: "Are urinary phenol concentrations of methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, triclosan, benzophenone-3, 2,4-dichlorophenol or 2,5-dichlorophenol associated with fecundability and early pregnancy loss? 2,5-dichlorophenol concentrations were associated with an increased odds of early pregnancy loss, and higher concentrations of butylparaben and triclosan were associated with an increase in fecundability. Phenols are chemicals with endocrine-disrupting potential found in everyday products. Despite plausible mechanisms of phenol reproductive toxicity, there are inconsistent results across few epidemiologic studies examining phenol exposure and reproductive function in non-fertility treatment populations. Specimens and data were from the North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study prospective cohort of 221 women attempting to conceive naturally from 1982 to 1986. This analysis includes data from 221 participants across 706 menstrual cycles, with 135 live births, 15 clinical miscarriages and 48 early pregnancy losses (before 42 days after the last menstrual period). Participants collected daily first-morning urine specimens. For each menstrual cycle, aliquots from three daily specimens across the cycle were pooled within individuals and analyzed for phenol concentrations. To assess sample repeatability, we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for each phenol. We evaluated associations between phenol concentrations from pooled samples and time to pregnancy using discrete-time logistic regression and generalized estimating equations (GEE), and early pregnancy loss using multivariable logistic regression and GEE. ICCs for within-person variability across menstrual cycles in pooled phenol concentrations ranged from 0.42 to 0.75. There was an increased odds of early pregnancy loss with 2,5-dichlorophenol concentrations although the CIs were wide (5th vs 1st quintile odds ratio (OR): 4.79; 95% CI: 1.06, 21.59). There was an increased per-cycle odds of conception at higher concentrations of butylparaben (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.44) and triclosan (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.99, 2.26) compared to non-detectable concentrations. No associations were observed between these endpoints and concentrations of other phenols examined. Limitations include the absence of phenol measurements for male partners and a limited sample size, especially for the outcome of early pregnancy loss, which reduced our power to detect associations. This study is the first to use repeated pooled measures to summarize phenol exposure and the first to investigate associations with fecundability and early pregnancy loss. Within-person phenol concentration variability underscores the importance of collecting repeated samples for future studies. Exposure misclassification could contribute to differences between the findings of this study and those of other studies, all of which used one urine sample to assess phenol exposure. This study also contributes to the limited literature probing potential associations between environmental exposures and early pregnancy loss, which is a challenging outcome to study as it typically occurs before a pregnancy is clinically recognized.

        title: "Biotransformation of oxybenzone and 3-(4-methylbenzylidene)camphor in Cunninghamella species: Potential for environmental clean-up of widely used sunscreen agents.",
        abstract: "The extensive use of organic UV filters (OUVFs) has led to these compounds being ubiquitously detected in the environment and considered a new kind of environmental pollutant. As OUVFs cannot be efficiently eliminated by conventional treatment processes, there is an urgent need to develop new innovative solutions for their removal. The present work investigates the efficacy of three Cunninghamella strains in the biodegradation of OUVFs: oxybenzone (BP-3) and 3-(4-methylbenzylidene)camphor (4-MBC). Moreover, a cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibition study was conducted, and Cunninghamella-processed samples in silico and in vitro toxicity were evaluated. Our results indicated the ability of Cunninghamella strains to utilize OUVFs. Among the tested Cunninghamella strains, both agents were the most efficiently removed by C. blakesleeana. These results were comparable with A. niger biodegradation capacity. In vitro studies of the fungi-processed samples confirmed no mutagenicity in the Ames test and the lack of cytotoxicity against HepG2 cell line. Moreover, Cunninghamella treatment positively influenced OUVFs SH-SY5Y neurotoxicity and ecotoxicity. After fungal treatment, BP-3 agonistic estrogenic activity was higher, whereas antagonistic androgenic effect was lower than before biotransformation. 4-MBC, after biotransformation, lost agonistic estrogenic activity, but gained antagonistic estrogenic properties. Additionally, this study confirmed the involvement of CYP450 enzymes in BP-3 and 4-MBC biotransformation, thus contributing to a better understanding of the detoxification pathways of OUVFs in fungi. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated, for the first time, that using environmental fungi Cunninghamella for the biodegradation of BP-3 and 4-MBC represents a potent approach for eliminating contaminants from the natural environment.",

        abstract: "Sunscreens are believed to be a valuable tool in providing photoprotection against the detrimental effects of UV radiation, a known carcinogen. However, a number of controversies have developed regarding their safety and efficacy. This review summarizes the relevant studies surrounding these controversies. Evidence of the prevention of skin cancer, an oft-cited reason for sunscreen use, was examined as it pertains to squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. We also reviewed studies examining the effects of sunscreen on the synthesis of vitamin D, an essential nutrient whose role in health and disease continues to grow. Lastly, we analyzed studies surrounding the safety and toxicity of oxybenzone, retinyl palmitate and nanoparticles of zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2 ). The overwhelming majority of available data is drawn from studies conducted using antiquated sunscreen formulations. Nonetheless, our research revealed that topical use of sunscreen protects against squamous cell carcinoma, does not cause vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in practice and has not been demonstrated to adversely affect the health of humans. Given the established benefits of UV protection, the use of sunscreens remains an important part of an overall photoprotective strategy. Future sunscreens with improved formulation should ideally offer superior protection. With increased usage of sunscreen by the public, continuous and vigilant monitoring of the overall safety of future products is also needed.",

        abstract: "Exposure to UV radiation damages the skin and increases the risk of skin cancer. Sunscreen is used to protect the skin from the harmful effects of UV radiation. However, the chemical UV filters used in sunscreen can show toxicity and cause allergic reactions. A safe sunscreen that includes a lower content of chemical UV filters and exerts an excellent effect on UV protection needs to be developed. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the addition of afzelin to sunscreen could improve the sun protection factor (SPF). A synergistic effect between afzelin and organic sunscreen agents including padimate O and oxybenzone was confirmed. Interestingly, 100% in vitro SPF-boosting was observed when afzelin (0.05%) was applied with a standard SPF formulation containing organic sunscreens while afzelin alone had no contribution to the SPF. In vivo SPF analysis of the standard SPF formulation showed an SPF value of 13.3 that increased to 20.1 when supplemented with afzelin (0.05%). Additionally, afzelin showed no skin irritation in a human trial. These results suggest that afzelin is useful as a natural additive in sunscreen formulations and provides an SPF-boosting effect. Afzelin supplementation to the formulation showed the potential to reduce the use of synthetic photoprotectors, which could minimize the risk of synthetic agent toxicity.",

To maximize compliance, adverse reactions to sunscreens should be minimized. Although inactive ingredients cause many of these reactions, it is important for dermatologists to be aware of reactions to active ultraviolet filters. There are approximately 120 chemicals that can function as ultraviolet (UV) filters. This review focuses on the 36 most common filters in commercial and historical use. Of these, 16 are approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. The benzophenones and dibenzoylmethanes are the most commonly implicated UV filters causing allergic and photoallergic contact dermatitis (PACD) reactions; benzophenone-3 is the leading allergen and photoallergen within this class. When clinically indicated, patch and photopatch testing should be performed to common UV filters.",

        abstract: "While mammographic breast density is associated with breast cancer risk in humans, there is no comparable surrogate risk measure in mouse and rat mammary glands following various environmental exposures. In the current study, mammary glands from mice and rats subjected to reproductive factors and exposures to environmental chemicals that have been shown to influence mammary gland development and/or susceptibility to mammary tumors were evaluated for histologic density by manual and automated digital methods. Digital histological density detected changes due to hormonal stimuli/reproductive factors (parity), dietary fat, and exposure to environmental chemicals, such as benzophenone-3 and a combination of perfluorooctanoic acid and zeranol. Thus, digital analysis of mammary gland density offers a high throughput method that can provide a highly reproducible means of comparing a measure of histological density across independent experiments, experimental systems, and laboratories. This methodology holds promise for the detection of environmental impacts on mammary gland structure in mice and rats that may be comparable to human breast density, thus potentially allowing comparisons between rodent models and human breast cancer studies.",

        abstract: "Today, topical application of sunscreens, containing ultraviolet-filters (UV-filters), is preferred protection against adverse effects of ultraviolet radiation. Evidently, use of sunscreens is effective in prevention of sunburns in various models. However, evidence for their protective effects against melanoma skin cancer is less conclusive. Three important observations prompted us to review the animal data and human studies on possible side effects of selected chemical UV-filters in cosmetics. (1) the utilization of sunscreens with UV-filters is increasing worldwide; (2) the incidence of the malignant disorder for which sunscreens should protect, malignant melanoma, is rapidly increasing and (3) an increasing number of experimental studies indicating that several UV-filters might have endocrine disruptive effects. The selected UV-filters we review in this article are benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 3-benzylidene camphor (3-BC), 3-(4-methyl-benzylidene) camphor (4-MBC), 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxy cinnamate (OMC), Homosalate (HMS), 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (OD-PABA) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). The potential adverse effects induced by UV-filters in experimental animals include reproductive/developmental toxicity and disturbance of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT). Few human studies have investigated potential side effects of UV-filters, although human exposure is high as UV-filters in sunscreens are rapidly absorbed from the skin. One of the UV-filters, BP-3, has been found in 96% of urine samples in the US and several UV-filters in 85% of Swiss breast milk samples. It seems pertinent to evaluate whether exposure to UV-filters contribute to possible adverse effects on the developing organs of foetuses and children.",

        title: "Enhanced Toxicity of Bisphenols Together with UV Filters in Water: Identification of Synergy and Antagonism in Three-Component Mixtures.",
        abstract: "Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) localize in the biome in variable combinations of complex mixtures that are often environmentally persistent, bioaccumulate and biomagnify, prompting a need for extensive monitoring. Many cosmetics include UV filters that are listed as CECs, such as benzophenone derivatives (oxybenzone, OXYB), cinnamates (2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate, EMC) and camphor derivatives (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, 4MBC). Furthermore, in numerous water sources, these UV filters have been detected together with Bisphenols (BPs), which are commonly used in plastics and can be physiologically detrimental. We utilized bioluminescent bacteria (Microtox assay) to monitor these CEC mixtures at environmentally relevant doses, and performed the first systematic study involving three sunscreen components (OXYB, 4MBC and EMC) and three BPs (BPA, BPS or BPF). Moreover, a breast cell line and cell viability assay were employed to determine the possible effect of these mixtures on human cells. Toxicity modeling, with concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) approaches, was performed, followed by data interpretation using Model Deviation Ratio (MDR) evaluation. The results show that UV filter sunscreen constituents and BPs interact at environmentally relevant concentrations. Of notable interest, mixtures containing any pair of three BPs (e.g., BPA + BPS, BPA + BPF and BPS + BPF), together with one sunscreen component (OXYB, 4MBC or EMC), showed strong synergy or overadditive effects. On the other hand, mixtures containing two UV filters (any pair of OXYB, 4MBC and EMC) and one BP (BPA, BPS or BPF) had a strong propensity towards concentration dependent underestimation. The three-component mixtures of UV filters (4MBC, EMC and OXYB) acted in an antagonistic manner toward each other, which was confirmed using a human cell line model. This study is one of the most comprehensive involving sunscreen constituents and BPs in complex mixtures, and provides new insights into potentially important interactions between these compounds.",

This study aims to investigate the damage of BP-3 at environmentally relevant concentrations to human chondrocytes, as well as potential mechanisms linking BP-3 with injury of chondrocytes. Notably, BP-3 significantly inhibited cell viability, induced apoptosis, and up-regulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and 13 which mediated cartilage degradation in C28/I2 human normal chondrocytes. Moreover, the function of mitochondria was impaired and oxidative stress occurred in BP-3 exposure groups, evidenced by elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, decrease of ATP production and inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, II, III and IV. Meanwhile, BP-3 caused mitochondrial cristae vague and formation of autophagosomes. PTEN induced putative kinase 1/E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PINK1/Parkin) pathway was also activated by BP-3. Addition of autophagy inhibitor, 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), suppressed PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, but increased BP-3-induced expression of MMP1 and 13, as well as exacerbated BP-3-induced apoptosis, suggesting mitophagy may exert a chondroprotective effect and partially alleviate apoptosis induced by this compound. In brief, BP-3 exposure may increase OA risk via inducing apoptosis and increasing breakdown of extracellular matrix in chondrocytes, and mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy may play a crucial role in the mechanisms of BP-3-induced toxicity to articular chondrocytes.",

        title: "Tobacco-associated with Methylophilus sp. FP-6 enhances phytoremediation of benzophenone-3 through regulating soil microbial community, increasing photosynthetic capacity and maintaining redox homeostasis of plant.",
        abstract: "Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) has attracted widespread attention due to its large accumulation in the environment and its potential toxicity effects to human. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the combined application of tobacco and Methylophilus sp. strain FP-6 with both plant growth promoting (PGP) traits and BP-3 degradation function on BP-3 remediation in soil. The results showed that about 79.18% of BP-3 was removed from the soil after 30 days of plant culture inoculated with the FP-6 strain, which was significantly higher than the plant-alone treatment. Simultaneously, inoculation with strain FP-6 significantly improved growth performance, biomass production, antioxidant levels, osmoregulation substance, photosynthetic capacity and chlorophyll accumulation in tobacco. Moreover, the application of FP-6 shifted the bacterial community, and enhanced the abundance of BP-3-degrading or soil nutrient cycling-affecting bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, Bryobacter, MND1 and Myxococcales), which might be valuable for the promotion of plant growth and degradation of BP-3 in the soil. The results from this study gave first insights into the enhancement of BP-3 removal efficiency from soil by phytoremediation assisted with bacteria possessing both PGP properties and BP-3 degradation function. The role of soil bacterial community in this remediation process was also discussed.",

        abstract: "A skin irritation test using <i>in vitro</i> reconstructed human epidermis (RhE) models was established for hazard identification of irritant chemicals in accordance with UN Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) category. In this study, EpiDerm™ was used to assess skin irritation by oxybenzone and N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), which are widely used sunscreen and insect repellent components, respectively. EpiDerm™ was applied with oxybenzone and DEET, combined and sequentially with each single dose. Epidermal morphology and differentiation/proliferation were examined microscopically. Oxybenzone and sequential administration groups were determined as nonirritant with cell viability >50% and the morphology was comparable to the human epidermis. Contrastingly, the DEET and coadministration groups exhibited cell viability <50% and poor epidermal morphology. Interleukin (IL)-1α release from substance-treated EpiDerm™ increased inversely to cell viability, suggesting the pro-inflammatory reaction was initiated by DEET. CK-10, E-cadherin, Ki-67, laminin, and ceramide were identified as relevant markers to assess oxybenzone- or DEET-induced epidermal injury. In conclusion, these results may indicate to be aware of the possible skin irritation by indiscriminate use of oxybenzone and DEET without animal testing.",

        title: "Assessment and clinical implications of absorption of sunscreens across skin.",
        abstract: "Topical sunscreen products are widely used for protection of the skin against the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Sunscreen agents are incorporated into many everyday-use cosmetics as well as so called 'beach' products. An ideal sunscreen product will provide effective protection against UV radiation with minimal skin absorption of the active ingredients. There is now clear evidence that a common sunscreen chemical, benzophenone-3, is absorbed systemically following topical application to the skin. Other more lipophilic sunscreens are absorbed into the skin, but penetration to deeper tissues and the cutaneous circulation appears to be limited. However, the extent to which sunscreens that are absorbed into the stratum corneum are absorbed to deeper tissues and the systemic circulation over time is currently unknown. The formulation vehicle in which the sunscreen is presented to the skin has a significant effect on absorption into and through the skin. Alcohol-based formulations appear to increase sunscreen absorption. In addition, some sunscreen chemicals may enhance the skin absorption of other sunscreens when applied in combination. Clearly, further research into the influence of sunscreen and formulation properties on skin absorption could lead to optimal design of sunscreen products with respect to efficacy and minimizing absorption. Despite the extensive use of sunscreen products, there have been few reports of adverse effects, and these tend to be limited to acute dermatitis and allergies. Some recent reports have raised concerns that sunscreen chemicals may damage tissues, particularly in the presence of UV radiation. Further research into the toxicity of sunscreens is urgently required. Given the information currently available and the importance of protecting the skin against sun damage, there is no clear justification for restricting the use of sunscreen products at this time.",

        title: "Human risk associated with exposure to mixtures of antiandrogenic chemicals evaluated using in vitro hazard and human biomonitoring data.",
        abstract: "Scientific evidence for underestimated toxicity from unintentional exposure to chemical mixtures is mounting. Yet, harmonized approaches on how to assess the actual risk of mixtures is lacking. As part of the European Joint programme 'Human Biomonitoring for Europe' we explored a novel methodology for mixture risk assessment of chemicals affecting male reproductive function. We explored a methodology for chemical mixture risk assessment based on human in vitro data combined with human exposure data, thereby circumventing the drawbacks of using hazard data from rodents and estimated exposure intake levels. Human androgen receptor (hAR) antagonism was selected as the most important molecular initiating event linked to adverse outcomes on male reproductive health. Our work identified 231 chemicals able to interfere with hAR activity. Among these were 61 finally identified as having both reliable hAR antagonist and human biomonitoring data. Calculation of risk quotients indicated that PCBs (118, 138, 157), phthalates (BBP, DBP, DIBP), benzophenone-3, PFOS, methylparaben, triclosan, some pesticides (i.e cypermethrin, β-endosulfan, methylparathion, p,p-DDE), and a PAH metabolite (1-hydroxypyrene) contributed to the mixture effect. The major chemical mixture drivers were PCB 118, BBP, PFOS, DBP, and the UV filter benzophenone-3, together contributing with 75% of the total mixture effect that was primarily driven by high exposure values. This viable way forward for mixture risk assessment of chemicals has the advantages of (1) being a more comprehensive mixture risk assessment also covering data-poor chemicals, and (2) including human data only. However, the approach is subjected to uncertainties in terms of in vitro to in vivo extrapolation, it is not ready for decision making, and needs further development. Still, the results indicate a concern for adverse effects on reproductive function in highly exposed boys, especially when considering additional exposure to data-poor chemicals and chemicals acting by other mechanisms of action.",

        abstract: "Chemical UV-filters are frequently applied as active ingredients in sunscreen to protect from detrimental effects of UV radiation. Regardless, many of these compounds are not well characterized concerning their capacity to counteract UV induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intracellular ROS release is an early event upon UV exposure and a crucial trigger of reaction cascades that may provoke adverse effects both in short- and long-term. We report a strategy to assess the capacity of UV-filters (ecamsule, oxybenzone and menthyl anthranilate) to counteract UVA/UVB stress in the human keratinocyte HaCaT and the wildtype Fibs E6/E7 fibroblast cell lines. The reduction of ROS levels was taken as primary endpoint. The effect of treatment on the cells' metabolic activity was analyzed as an indicator of viability post-treatment, to investigate potential immediate and late (photo)toxicity. Additionally, the compounds' antioxidative capacity was investigated using an azo-based radical generator. Established antioxidants, quercetin and N-acetylcysteine, were used as controls. Data showed remarkable differences in the mode of action of the chemical UV-filters, ranging from protective to pro-oxidative properties, indicating the need for more detailed mode of action-based investigations. Certainly, additional consideration and evaluation will be necessary to further extrapolate these in vitro data for the assessment of in vivo exposure situations. However, the presented approach enables parallel investigations of photoprotective and phototoxic effects of UV-filters, and thus can complement and extent existing in vitro testing strategies.",

        abstract: "In this study, we analyzed the occurrence and distribution of 11 benzophenone-type ultraviolet filters (BPs) in 893 food samples spanning 7 food categories in Taiwan. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks of BPs. The results indicated that cornflakes had the highest mean level of BPs (103 ng/g), followed by bread (101 ng/g) and pastries (59 ng/g). BP was the most prevalent category, followed by 4-methylbenzophenone (4-MBP), 2-hydroxybenzophenone, and benzophenone-3. Estimation of the lifetime cancer risk (LTCR) of BP (average life expectancy of 80 years) placed them in the 50th and 97.5th percentiles [P50 (P97.5)] LTCR of 1.9 × 10<sup>-7</sup> (5.7 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), indicating that BP in food poses a low renal hazard to the Taiwanese population. The noncarcinogenic risk of BPs was evaluated using a hazard quotient and combined margin of exposure (MOE<sub>T</sub>), revealing a P50 (P97.5) hazard index of < 1 for BP, 4-MBP, and methyl-2-benzoylbenzoate. Although the P50 MOE<sub>T</sub> values for all age groups were within the moderate range of concern, with a more conservative extreme (P2.5), the MOE<sub>T</sub> values for the 0-3, 3-6, and 6-12 age groups fell below 100, indicating a high concern for renal degeneration and hyperplasia.",

        abstract: "Adolescence is a period of significant physiological changes, and likely a sensitive window to chemical exposure. Few nation-wide population-based studies of chemical body burdens in adolescents have been published. In the national dietary survey Riksmaten Adolescents (RMA) 2016-17, over 13 chemical substance groups, including elements, chlorinated/brominated/fluorinated persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were analysed in blood, and in urine metabolites of phthalates/phthalate alternatives, phosphorous flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and pesticides, along with bisphenols and biocide/preservative/antioxidant/UV filter substances (N = 1082, ages 11-21). The aim was to characterize the body burdens in a representative population of adolescents in Sweden, and to compare results with human biomonitoring guidance values (HBM-GVs). Cluster analyses and Spearman's rank order correlations suggested that concentrations of substances with known common exposure sources and similar toxicokinetics formed obvious clusters and showed moderate to very strong correlations (r ≥ 0.4). No clusters were formed between substances from different matrices. Geometric mean (GM) concentrations of the substances were generally less than 3-fold different from those observed among adolescents in NHANES (USA 2015-16) and GerES V (Germany 2014-17). Notable exceptions were brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) with >20-fold lower GM concentrations, and the biocide triclosan and ultraviolet (UV) filter benzophenone-3 with >15-fold lower mean concentrations in RMA compared to NHANES. Exceedance of the most conservative HBM-GVs were observed for aluminium (Al, 26% of subjects), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS, 19%), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, 12%), lead (Pb, 12%), MBP (dibutyl phthalate metabolite, 4.8%), hexachlorobenzene (HCB, 3.1%) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA, pyrethroid metabolite, 2.2%). Males showed a higher proportion of exceedances than females for Pb, HCB and PFOS; otherwise no gender-related differences in exceedances were observed. A higher proportion of males than females had a Hazard Index (HI) of substances with liver and kidney toxicity and neurotoxicity >1. Industrialized countries with similarly high standards of living, with some exceptions, show comparable average body burdens of a variety of toxic chemicals among adolescents from the general population. The exceedances of HBM-GVs and HIs strongly suggests that further efforts to limit chemical exposure are warranted.",

        abstract: "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the main exogenous inductor of skin damage and so photoprotection is important to control skin disorders. The Antarctic moss Sanionia uncinata is an important source of antioxidants and the photoprotective activity of its organic extracts has been investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the potential photoprotection, cytotoxicity and embryotoxicity of residual aqueous fraction (AF) from the moss S. uncinata. UV-visible spectrum and SPF (sun protection factor) were determined by spectrophotometry. Embryotoxicity potential was evaluated by Fish embryo-larval toxicity test using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as organism model. Cell death assays by water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were investigated using HaCaT keratinocyte cell line cultured in monolayers and three dimensions (3D). Phototoxicity and association with UV-filters were performed by 3T3 neutral red uptake test. The AF showed sharp absorption bands in the UV region and less pronounced in the visible region. The SPF was low (2.5 ± 0.3), but the SPF values of benzophenone-3 and octyl-methoxycinnamate increased ~ 3 and 4 times more, respectively, in association with AF. The AF did not induce significant lethal and sublethal effects on zebrafish early-life stages. In monolayers, the HaCaT cell viability, evaluated by WST-1, was above 70% by ≤0.4 mg AF/mL after 48 and 72-h exposure, whereas ≤1 mg AF/mL after 24-h exposure. The LDH assay showed that the cell viability was above 70% by ≤0.4 mg AF/mL even after 72-h exposure, but ≤1 mg/mL after 24 and 48-h exposure. In 3D cell culture, an increased cell resistance to toxicity was observed, because cell viability of HaCaT cell by WST-1 and LDH was above ~ 90% when using ≤1 and 4 mg AF/mL, respectively. The AF demonstrated values of photo irritation factor < 2 and of photo effect < 0.1, even though in association with UV-filters. The residual AF absorbs UV-vis spectrum, increased SPF values of BP-3 and OMC and does not induce embryotoxicity to zebrafish early life-stage. The cell death assays allowed establishing non-toxic doses of AF and phototoxicity was not detected. AF of S. uncinata presents a good potential for skin photoprotection against UV-radiation.",

        abstract: "Given the prevalence of skin cancer, sunscreens are recommended by dermatologists including the American Academy of Dermatology to protect skin from harmful ultraviolet rays. Unfortunately, this leads to an estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen entering waterways each year. Many of the chemicals in sunscreens, such as oxybenzone and benzophenone-2, are indicated to have adverse effects on corals and other aquatic life. As an eco-conscious alternative, physical barrier sunscreens, such as non-nano-titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), have been suggested as a replacement. This study examines the impact of a non-nano-TiO<sub>2</sub>-based sunscreen over a nationally sold brand of sunscreen containing oxybenzone, on clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris). Animals were evaluated for mortality, swimming behavior, and feeding behavior. Our data indicate that at an exposure level of 100 mg/L oxybenzone-containing sunscreen had a negative impact on mortality, leading to 25% death by the end of the 97-h testing period. Negative impacts on behavior were even more dramatic for the 100 mg/L oxybenzone-containing sunscreen, with 100% of the animals failing to feed over the first 49 h of testing and 100% of animals demonstrating abnormal swimming behavior over the entire testing period. By comparison, the non-nano-(TiO<sub>2</sub>) sunscreen at 100 mg/L had little (6.7%) negative impact on mortality and feeding. While swimming behavior was disrupted during the first 25 h of testing (26.7% abnormal movement), animals recovered well over the remainder of the testing period (out to 97 h).",

        title: "Computational study on the endocrine-disrupting metabolic activation of Benzophenone-3 catalyzed by cytochrome P450 1A1: A QM/MM approach.",
        abstract: "Predicting the metabolic activation mechanism and potential hazardous metabolites of environmental endocrine-disruptors is a challenging and significant task in risk assessment. Here the metabolic activation mechanism of benzophenone-3 catalyzed by P450 1A1 was investigated by using Molecular Dynamics, Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics and Density Functional Theory approaches. Two elementary reactions involved in the metabolic activation of BP-3 with P450 1A1: electrophilic addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions were both discussed. Further conversion reactions of epoxidation products, ketone products and the formaldehyde formation reaction were investigated in the non-enzymatic environment based on previous experimental reports. Binding affinities analysis of benzophenone-3 and its metabolites to sex hormone binding globulin indirectly demonstrates that they all exhibit endocrine-disrupting property. Toxic analysis shows that the eco-toxicity and bioaccumulation values of the benzophenone-3 metabolites are much lower than those of benzophenone-3. However, the metabolites are found to have skin-sensitization effects. The present study provides a deep insight into the biotransformation process of benzophenone-3 catalyzed by P450 1A1 and alerts us to pay attention to the adverse effects of benzophenone-3 and its metabolites in human livers.",

        abstract: "A one-pot methodology for the tandem acylation and oxidative aromatization of vinylogous thioesters to 2-acyl-5-(alkyl/arylthio) phenols is presented. Initially, cyclohexane-1,3-diones were converted to vinylogous thioesters through FeCl<sub>3</sub>-mediated thioenolization. This was followed by LiTMP-mediated acylation and DDQ-mediated aromatization, which resulted in the synthesis of sulphur derived oxybenzone analogs. Notably, replacing the methoxy group of oxybenzone with alkylthioxy or arylthioxy groups significantly enhanced UV absorption properties. The newly synthesized oxybenzone analogs exhibited superior UV absorption, effectively covering the entire UVA and UVB regions spanning from 240 to 440 nm. Furthermore, toxicity studies conducted on HEK293T cells demonstrated that many of the thio-analogs exhibit lower toxicity compared to parent oxybenzone, suggests potential for safer and more effective UV protection formulas.",

        title: "Toxic effects and transcriptome analyses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae exposed to benzophenones.",
        abstract: "Sunscreen chemicals, such as benzophenones (BPs), are common environmental contaminants that are posing a growing health concern due to their increasing presence in water, fish, and human systems. Benzoresorcinol (BP1), oxybenzone (BP3), and dioxybenzone (BP8) are the most commonly used BPs for their ability to protect from sunburn by absorbing a broad spectrum of ultraviolet radiation. In this study, zebrafish larvae were used as an in vivo model to investigate the potential risks and molecular mechanisms of the toxic effects of BPs. The effects of these BPs on the gene expression in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway, estrogen receptor pathway, and sex differentiation were detected using quantitative real-time PCR. All BPs were found to function as agonists of the estrogen receptors α and β1, indicating that these BPs likely undergo similar molecular metabolism in vivo, whereby they can activate cytochrome P450 genes and promote the expression of CYP19A and DMRT1. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of larvae after BP3 exposure was evaluated using a whole transcriptome sequencing approach. BP3 affected estradiol biosynthesis and sex differentiation. It also regulated gonadotropin-releasing hormone, thus interfering with the endocrine system. As a xenobiotic toxicant, BP3 upregulated the expression of cytochrome P450 genes (CYP1A and CYP3A65) and glutathione metabolism-related genes (GSTA, GSTM, and GSTP). It also interfered with the nervous system by regulating the calcium signaling pathway. These findings will be useful for understanding the toxicity mechanisms and metabolism of BPs in aquatic organisms and promote the regulation of these chemicals in the environment.",

        title: "Pregnancy exposure to synthetic phenols and placental DNA methylation - An epigenome-wide association study in male infants from the EDEN cohort.",
        abstract: "In utero exposure to environmental chemicals, such as synthetic phenols, may alter DNA methylation in different tissues, including placenta - a critical organ for fetal development. We studied associations between prenatal urinary biomarker concentrations of synthetic phenols and placental DNA methylation. Our study involved 202 mother-son pairs from the French EDEN cohort. Nine phenols were measured in spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks. We performed DNA methylation analysis of the fetal side of placental tissues using the IlluminaHM450 BeadChips. We evaluated methylation changes of individual CpGs in an adjusted epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We performed mediation analysis to test whether placental tissue heterogeneity mediated the association between urinary phenol concentrations and DNA methylation. We identified 46 significant DMRs (≥5 CpGs) associated with triclosan (37 DMRs), 2,4-dichlorophenol (3), benzophenone-3 (3), methyl- (2) and propylparaben (1). All but 2 DMRs were positively associated with phenol concentrations. Out of the 46 identified DMRs, 7 (6 for triclosan) encompassed imprinted genes (APC, FOXG1, GNAS, GNASAS, MIR886, PEG10, SGCE), which represented a significant enrichment. Other identified DMRs encompassed genes encoding proteins responsible for cell signaling, transmembrane transport, cell adhesion, inflammatory, apoptotic and immunological response, genes encoding transcription factors, histones, tumor suppressors, genes involved in tumorigenesis and several cancer risk biomarkers. Mediation analysis suggested that placental cell heterogeneity may partly explain these associations. This is the first study describing the genome-wide modifications of placental DNA methylation associated with pregnancy exposure to synthetic phenols or their precursors. Our results suggest that cell heterogeneity might mediate the effects of triclosan exposure on placental DNA methylation. Additionally, the enrichment of imprinted genes within the DMRs suggests mechanisms by which certain exposures, mainly to triclosan, could affect fetal development.",

        abstract: "UV filters in current sunscreen formulations can have negative effects on human health, such as endocrine disruption and allergic reactions, as well as on the environment, including bioaccumulation and coral health toxicity. As a result, there is a need to find alternative compounds that serve as safer and more ecofriendly active ingredients. This study successfully isolated actinomycetes from the octocoral <i>Eunicea fusca</i> and assessed their potential as producers of photoprotective compounds. The use of bio-based chemical agents, particularly natural products, has been a highly effective strategy for discovering bioactive compounds, especially in marine invertebrates and their associated microbiota. Eighteen bacterial isolates were obtained and subsequently employed to prepare raw methanolic extracts from seven-day submerged cultures in Zobell marine broth. The resulting extracts were screened for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging capacity and characterized by total phenolic and flavonoid content measurements. After screening, the <i>Gordonia hongkongensis</i> EUFUS-Z928-derived raw extract exhibited the best antioxidant profile, i.e. DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging of 4.93 and 6.00 µmol Trolox per gram of extract, respectively, and selected for further photoprotection-related analysis. Thus, this extract demonstrated a UV-absorbing capacity of 46.33% of the <i>in vitro</i> sun protection factor calculated for 30 µg/mL oxybenzone but did not exhibit any cytotoxicity on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa cell line) at concentrations up to 500 µg/mL. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry chemical characterization of this extract showed compounds with structural features associated with free radical scavenging and UV absorption (i.e. photoprotection-related activities). These findings highlighted the potential of the microbiota associated with <i>E. fusca</i> and confirmed the feasibility of exploiting its metabolites for photoprotection-related purposes.",

        abstract: "Benzophenone-UV filters (BP-UV filters) are extensively used in cosmetics products to avoid damaging effects of UV radiation. Despite their low toxicity, many research papers indicate that BP-UV filters are weak endocrine disruptors (EDCs). There are clear relationships between BP-UV filters exposure and several health disorders such as carcinogenesis and malformations observed in animals. In the present work, a new sample treatment procedure by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) is proposed for the extraction of six BPs, namely benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-2 (BP-2), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), benzophenone-6 (BP-6), benzophenone-8 (BP-8) and 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OH-BP), in human serum samples, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The method involves an enzymatic treatment to quantify the total content (free plus conjugated species) of BP-UV filters in serum. The extraction parameters were accurately optimized using multivariate optimization approach. Benzophenone-d₁₀ (BP-d₁₀) was used as surrogate. Limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 0.4 to 0.9 ng mL(-1) and inter-day precision (evaluated as relative standard deviation) ranged from 1.9% to 13.1%. The method was validated using matrix-matched calibration and a recovery assay. Recovery rates for spiked samples ranged from 97% to 106%, and acceptable linearity was obtained up to concentrations of 40 ng mL(-1). The method was applied to the determination of the target compounds in human serum samples from 20 randomly selected anonymous individuals.",

Dermatologists have an overall positive view of sunscreen. 99% of dermatologists agree that regular sunscreen use helps lower skin cancer risk, reduces subsequent photoaging, and recommend their family/friends use sunscreen. Most dermatologists believe that oxybenzone and retinyl palmitate are safe in sunscreen (86% and 85%, respectively). Dermatologists used multiple sunscreen recommendation criteria including Sun Protection Factor (SPF) level, broad spectrum protection, cosmetic elegance/feel, and photostability (96%, 98%, 85%, and 68%, respectively). The use of sunscreen remains a critical part of sun protection. Therefore, it is important to assess and understand the perspective and patient recommendations provided by dermatologists. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1121-1123.",

        abstract: "Benzophenone-type UV filters (BPs) are ubiquitous in the environment. Transformation products (TPs) of BPs with suspected toxicity are likely to be produced during disinfection of water by chlorination. To quickly predict the toxicity of TPs, in this study, a novel two-dimensional liquid-chromatography (2D-LC) method was established in which the objective of the first dimension was to separate the multiple components of the BPs sample after chlorination, using a reversed-phase liquid-chromatography mode. A biochromatographic system, i.e. bio-partitioning micellar chromatography with the polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether aqueous solution as the mobile phase, served as the second dimension to predict the toxicity of the fraction from the first dimension on the basis of the quantitative retention-activity relationships (QRARs) model. Six BPs, namely 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone, oxybenzone, 4-hydroxybenzophenone, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonic acid, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone and 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, were the target analytes subjected to chlorination. The products of these BPs after chlorination were directly injected to the 2D-LC system for analysis. The results indicated that most TPs may be less toxic than their parent chemicals, but some may be more toxic, and that intestinal toxicity of TPs may be more obvious than blood toxicity. The proposed method is time-saving, high-throughput, and reliable, and has great potential for predicting toxicity or bioactivity of unknown and/or known components in a complex sample.

        abstract: "Ultraviolet (UV) filters are emerging contaminants that have been found in high concentrations in human tissues. Food intake is generally considered to be the primary route of human exposure to contaminants. In this study, 184 composite food samples, prepared from 4268 individual samples in eight categories collected from 23 Chinese provinces for the sixth Chinese total diet study, were analyzed. The total and median UV filter concentrations in food samples were 1.5-68.3 and 7.9 ng/g wet weight, respectively. The highest median concentrations were found in decreasing order in meat, cereals, and legumes. In total, 15 UV filters were analyzed. 2-Ethylhexyl salicylate, homosalate, and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate were dominant and made median contributions of 34.1%, 22.6%, and 14.5%, respectively, and 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-di-<i>tert</i>-pentylphenol contributed the median of 0.03%, of the total UV filter concentrations. The estimated total daily UV filter intake in animal-origin foods and total UV filter concentration in human milk from the same province were significantly correlated (r = 0.44, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Predicted absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination properties led to 10 UV filters being prioritized as most likely to be retained in human tissues. The prioritization results and toxicity assessments indicated that octocrylene and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate have stronger effects in vivo and therefore require more attention than others.",

        abstract: "Organic UV filters are a group of emerging PPCP (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) contaminants. Current information is insufficient to understand the in vivo processes and health risks of organic UV filters in humans. The interaction mechanism of UV filters with serum albumin provides critical information for the health risk assessment of these active ingredients in sunscreen products. This study investigates the interaction mechanisms of five commonly used UV filters (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, BP-3; 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate, EHMC; 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, 4-MBC; methoxydibenzoylmethane, BDM; homosalate, HMS) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) by spectroscopic measurements of fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), competitive binding experiments and molecular docking. Our results indicated that the fluorescence of BSA was quenched by these UV filters through a static quenching mechanism. The values of the binding constant (Ka) ranged from (0.78±0.02)×10(3) to (1.29±0.01)×10(5) L mol(-1). Further exploration by synchronous fluorescence and CD showed that the conformation of BSA was demonstrably changed in the presence of these organic UV filters. It was confirmed that the UV filters can disrupt the α-helical stability of BSA. Moreover, the results of molecular docking revealed that the UV filter molecule is located in site II (sub-domain IIIA) of BSA, which was further confirmed by the results of competitive binding experiments. In addition, binding occurred mainly through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. This study raises critical concerns regarding the transportation, distribution and toxicity effects of organic UV filters in human body.",

        title: "Encapsulation and controlled release of retinol from silicone particles for topical delivery.",
        abstract: "Retinol, a derivative of vitamin A, is a ubiquitous compound used to treat acne, reduce wrinkles and protect against conditions like psoriasis and ichthyosis. While retinol is used as the primary active ingredient (AI) in many skin care formulations, its efficacy is often limited by an extreme sensitivity to degrade and toxicity at high concentrations. While microencapsulation is an appealing method to help overcome these issues, few microencapsulation strategies have made a major translational impact due to challenges with complexity, cost, limited protection of the AI and poor control of the release of the AI. We have developed a class of silicone particles that addresses these challenges for the encapsulation, protection and controlled release of retinol and other hydrophobic compounds. The particles are prepared by the sol-gel polymerization of silane monomers, which enables their rapid and facile synthesis at scale while maintaining a narrow size distribution (i.e., CV < 20%). We show that our particles can: (i) encapsulate retinol with high efficiency (>85%), (ii) protect retinol from degradation (yielding a half-life 9× greater than unencapsulated retinol) and (iii) slowly release retinol over several hours (at rates from 0.14 to 0.67 μg cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1/2</sup>). To demonstrate that the controlled release of retinol from the particles can reduce irritation, we performed a double blind study on human subjects and found that formulations containing our particles were 12-23% less irritating than identical formulations containing Microsponge® particles (an industry standard by Amcol, Inc.). To show that the silicone particles can elicit a favorable biological response, similar to the Microsponge® particles, we applied both formulations to reconstructed human epidermal tissues and found an upregulation of keratin 19 (K19) and a downregulation of K10, indicating that the reduced irritation observed in the human study was not caused by reduced activity. We also found a decrease in the production of interleukin-1α (IL-1α) compared to formulations containing the Microsponge particles, suggesting lower irritation levels and supporting the findings from the human study. Finally, we show that the silicone particles can encapsulate other AIs, including betamethasone, N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), homosalate and ingenol mebutate, establishing these particles as a true platform technology.",

        title: "Emerging contaminants and priority substances in marine sediments from Cartagena Bay and the Grand Marsh of Santa Marta (Ramsar site), Colombia.",
        abstract: "Emerging pollutants and priority substances are of growing concern due to their toxicity potential to aquatic organisms and human health. However, few reports on this issue in marine ecosystems in general and, more specifically, on the Colombian Caribbean coast are available. The aim of this study was to detect these compounds in sediments from Cartagena Bay (CB) and in the Grand Marsh of Santa Marta, GMSM (Ramsar site), in order to determine how they related to in vitro cytotoxicity assays on HepG2 cells of sediment extracts. A total of thirty compounds were detected using GC-MS/MS in fifteen stations during both the rainy and the dry seasons. Sediments from CB had a wide range of different toxicants, with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) being the most prevalent (12 PAHs, 5.5-881.6 ng/g). Total PCBs ranged from < LOD to 18.6 ng/g, with PCB 138 being the most common detected congener. Residues of p,p'-DDE, Chlorpyrifos and two organophosphate flame retardants, TEHP and ToTP, were found in most sampling locations. The UV filters 4MBC and homosalate were recurrently found in sediments, and the fragrance galaxolide appeared in all cases, with the greatest concentrations found on a touristic beach. In GMSM, with the exception of deltamethrin, all chemicals evaluated had lower average values than in CB. According to sediment quality guidelines, some sites in CB presented values of PAHs higher than the threshold effects level, while in the marsh, none of the stations exceeded it. HepG2 cells exposed to 1% sediment extracts presented reduced cell viability up to 26%. Cytotoxicity displayed a negative correlation with chlorpyrifos concentration. In short, these data suggest the bay and the marsh have specific contamination fingerprints related to anthropogenic interventions. This research highlights the need to further investigate the ecotoxicological implications of detected chemical stressors in these ecosystems.",

        abstract: "The increasing awareness of the damaging effects of UV radiation to human skin triggered the market introduction of new cosmetic UV absorbers. This article summarizes the outcome of a multi-year research program, in which the author contributed to the development of different new UV filters. First of all, the molecular design and the basic properties of bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (BEMT) will be presented. This oil-soluble filter, which today is widely used in both beach products and skin care products, exhibits inherent photostability and strong broad-spectrum UV-A+B absorbance. Based on the concept of micronized organic UV absorbers, the UV-B filter tris biphenyl triazine (TBPT) will be introduced. At present TBPT exhibits the highest efficacy of all cosmetic UV absorbers in the market (measured by area under the UV spectrum). Finally, the concept of liposomogenic UV absorbers will be featured. This approach was developed to create water-resistant UV filters, as liposomogenic structures are thought to integrate into the lipids of the horny layer. Due to prohibitively high costs, this technology did not result in a commercial product so far.",

        abstract: "It is now well documented that chronic UVA exposure induces damage to human skin. Therefore, modern sunscreens should not only provide protection from both UVB and UVA radiation but also maintain this protection during the entire period of exposure to the sun. UVA filters, however, are rare and not sufficiently photostable. We investigated the effect of the introduction of a new UV filter, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), in oil in water sunscreen formulations on the photostability of butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone [AVB]) after irradiation with an optically filtered Xenon arc source (UV irradiance adjusted at 1 mean effective dose [MED]/min). With spectrophotometrical methods to assess the sun protection factor (SPF) and UVA ratio and chromatographical methods to determine the amount of UV filters recovered after irradiation we showed that Tinosorb S prevented the photodegradation of AVB in a concentration-dependent way, leading to a sustained SPF and UVA ratio even after irradiation with doses of up to 30 MED. Since AVB was shown to destabilize ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHM) we tested the effect of Tinosorb S in sunscreens containing this UV filter combination. Here too Tinosorb S showed photoprotective properties toward both UV filters. Thus, Tinosorb S can be used successfully to improve the photostability and efficiency of sunscreens containing AVB and EHM.",

        abstract: "This study aimed to assess the phototoxic potential of combined UV-filters and retinyl palmitate (RP) in the presence or not of bemotrizinol (BMTZ), employing photostability and in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity assays. The formulations tested contained octocrylene (OCT), octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), benzophenone-3 (BZP-3) and RP (photostable) or octocrylene (OCT), octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), avobenzone (AVO) and RP (less photostable). Both formulations were supplemented with bemotrizinol. Photostability was evaluated by exposing, or not, formulations spread on a glass plate to UVA/UVB irradiation. The resulting products were quantified by HPLC analysis. In vitro phototoxicity of UV-filters and combinations were evaluated using 3T3 viable monolayer fibroblast cultures submitted, or not, to irradiation according to OECD TG 432. In vivo photoallergy and photoxicity were assessed by clinical studies (photopatch test). Photostability assays showed that UV-filter bemotrizinol was a better photostabilizer for RP/benzophenone-3 than for RP/avobenzone. The in vitro phototoxicity of the combination RP/avobenzone was reduced by bemotrizinol. Clinical studies did not indicate phototoxic or photoallergenic potentials in all formulations tested. It is concluded that the 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test may be considered a supplementary assay in formulation developments, since it can detect chemically unstable and potentially phototoxic combinations. However, extrapolation of in vitro positive results to human photopatch tests may be performed only to a limited extent.",

        abstract: "The increased awareness of protection against UV radiation damages has led to a rise in the use of topically applied chemical sunscreen agents and to an increased need of innovative carriers designed to achieve the highest protective effect and reduce the toxicological risk resulting from the percutaneous absorption of these substances. In this paper, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and nanoemulsions (NE) were formulated to optimize the topical application of different and widespread UVA or UVB sun filters (ethyl hexyltriazone (EHT), diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (DHHB), bemotrizinol (Tinosorb S), octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC) and avobenzone (AVO)). The preparation and stability parameters of these nanocarriers have been investigated concerning particle size and zeta potential. The release pattern of the sunscreens from NLC and NE was evaluated in vitro, determining their percutaneous absorption through excised human skin. Additional in vitro studies were performed in order to evaluate, after UVA radiation treatment, the spectral stability of the sunfilters once formulated in NLC or NE. From the results obtained, when incorporated in NLC, the skin permeation abilities of the sun filter were drastically reduced, remaining mainly on the surface of the skin. The photostability studies showed that EHT, DHHB and Tinosorb S still retain their photostability when incorporated in these carriers, while OMC and AVO were not photostable as expected. However, no significant differences in terms of photoprotective efficacy between the two carriers were observed.",

        abstract: "Polymorphic light eruption (PLE), with an overall prevalence of 10-20%, is mainly provoked by ultraviolet A (UVA) (320-400 nm) and to a lesser degree by UVB (280-320 nm). The most effective prophylaxis of PLE, application of UV protection clothing, is not feasible for all sun-exposed areas of the skin and UV-hardening is time-consuming and may be associated with side-effects. Most sunscreens protect predominantly against UVB and therefore fail to prevent PLE. The protection level of potent UVA-protective filters remains unresolved. This single-centre, open, placebo-controlled, intra-individual, comparative study, analysed the efficacy of a sunscreen of very high protection level against UVB and UVA, containing methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M), bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S) and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane as UVA absorbing filters, in the prevention of PLE under standardized photodiagnostic conditions. After determination of the minimal erythema dose at day 0, photoprovocation was performed in 12 patients with a clinical history of PLE, on days 1, 2 and 3 with 100 J/cm2 UVA and variable doses of UVB, starting with the 1.5-fold minimal erythema dose of UVB. Prior to irradiation, placebo was applied to the right and sunscreen to the left dorsal forearm under COLIPA (European Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association) conditions. In 10 patients PLE could be provoked at the placebo site, with positive reactions in 90% of the UVA, 40% of the UVB and 90% of the UVA/UVB irradiated fields. At the site with the active treatment none of these patients developed PLE. These data demonstrate that a sunscreen with effective filters against UVA and UVB can successfully prevent the development of PLE. Further studies are needed to examine whether regular application of sunscreen under everyday conditions, especially in doses less than the tested COLIPA-norm, could be an equivalent alternative to UV-hardening therapy.",

        abstract: "For many years, individuals around the world have relied on sunscreen alone as their primary form of protection against ultraviolet rays (UV-R). Australia has shown that a multitactic approach to skin cancer prevention, combining sun-protective clothing with sunscreen, can be both highly effective and widely accepted by the general public. In the US, the aging baby boomer generation and rising skin cancer epidemic call for a fundamental behavioral shift toward this combination approach to sun protection. Sun-protective clothing, such as that manufactured by Coolibar and awarded the Seal of Recommendation by The Skin Cancer Foundation, offers millions of Americans the opportunity to significantly improve the quality of their lives and is an essential step in eliminating skin cancer in our world. All Coolibar clothing products carry a minimum ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) rating of 30, blocking 97% UV-R or greater. Each product in the Coolibar clothing line is individually tested and rated for its UV protection level; this process is explained in a thorough hangtag attached to the product. This tag specifies what UPF the product has received, how the UPF is figured, which testing procedures the individual product was submitted to, and if that product has received the Seal of Recommendation from The Skin Cancer Foundation. In addition to photoprotective clothing, The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends Rit Sun Guard, a photoprotective laundry additive. Rit Sun Guard washes into the clothing fibers and absorbs broadband UV-R. A single treatment of Rit Sun Guard sustains a UPF of 30 for approximately 20 launderings. The active ingredient in Rit Sun Guard is TINOSORB FD. In order to be certified by The Skin Cancer Foundation, the Coolibar clothing product must undergo extensive UPF testing to confirm the accuracy of the product labeling. Laundry additives evaluated by The Skin Cancer Foundation undergo similar tests to that of photoprotective clothing after a uniform laundering method is used to apply the product to the clothing fibers. Both of these certification processes confirm the UPF, UV-A and UV-B transmittance, and percentage blocking UV-A and UV-B. The certification process is reviewed on an annual basis.",

        abstract: "Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation increases skin pigmentation and usually results in an even darkening of the skin. However, it may also occasionally lead to the development of hyperpigmented lesions due to a local overproduction of pigment. Skin pigmentation is induced both by UVB and UVA rays. The in vivo protection by sunscreens against pigmentation was studied using the determination of a level of protection against pigmentation based on the standardized sun protection factor (SPF) test method. The method includes delayed UVB and UVA pigmentations. The level of prevention against pigmentation was determined 7 days after exposure to solar-simulated radiation by visual assessment. It was calculated using the ratio of the minimal pigmenting dose on protected skin to the minimal pigmenting dose on unprotected skin. Broadspectrum UVB/UVA filters, Mexoryl SX and Mexoryl XL, and complete formula were tested. Protection against pigmentation correlates with the concentration of Mexoryl SX. The levels of protection obtained show a synergetic effect of Mexoryl SX when associated with Mexoryl XL. When different products having the same SPF (same protection against erythema) and different levels of UVA protection are compared, only sunscreen products with a high level of UVA protection show a similar level of protection against sunburn and pigmentation. Products with low UVA protection have a lower capacity of preventing induced pigmentation compared with their efficacy against erythema. These studies have evidenced that SPF determination was not sufficient to account for the efficiency in preventing pigmentation and that UVA protection was an essential part of this prevention.",

        abstract: "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an increased skin cancer risk due to defective repair of ultraviolet (UV)-radiation induced DNA damage. Therefore patients with XP are required to apply stringent sun-protection. Since the skin needs UV-B irradiation for de novo vitamin D synthesis, it has been postulated that sun-protection may lead to a clinically relevant reduction of vitamin D levels. To investigate whether reduced vitamin D levels in XP-patients are caused by the stringent sun-protection measures employed, in this study we examined 15 patients with XP. The 25-hydroxyvitamin (25-OHD) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D) serum levels were measured. Additionally, patients received a questionnaire about their sun-protection-behaviour. Serum levels for 25-OHD were decreased in 10 of 15 (67%) patients, however there was no statistically significant association between decreased 25-OHD serum levels and duration of sun-protection (p = 0.84). Results for 1,25-(OH)2D levels showed a probability of < 0.16 and between 0.16 and 0.77 for sun-protection duration of < 20 and 20 to 40 years, respectively (p = 0.0058). There was no statistically significant association between the duration of sun-protection with drometrizole trisiloxane and the probability of reduced 25-OHD and 1,25-(OH)2D levels. In conclusion, this investigation indicates that vitamin D serum levels in patients with XP may be normal, increased or decreased but this is not causally linked to the stringent photoprotective measures carried out in our group of investigated XP-patients.",

Countries such as Europe have 30+ UV filters approved for sunscreen products while the US has about 10, greatly reducing the options to provide diverse, effective sun protection products. Bemotrizinol (BEMT) is the first new sunscreen active ingredient to be evaluated for inclusion in the Over-The-Counter (OTC) sunscreen monograph using FDA's new Generally Recognized as Safe and Effective (GRASE) testing guidelines. An in vitro skin permeation test (IVPT) and clinical pilot pharmacokinetic Maximum Usage Trial (MUsT) were completed to support the GRASE determination for 6% BEMT. IVPT results indicated an oil +10% ethanol as the model sunscreen intervention for the pilot MUsT. The open-label trial revealed: BEMT concentrations rarely exceeded FDA's defined threshold (0.5 ng/mL) in plasma; no evidence for BEMT accumulation or steady-state concentrations above threshold; only one moderate and few mild treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Therefore, maximal topical applications of 6% BEMT in a model sunscreen formulation did not contribute to meaningful systemic exposure. These results support the safety of BEMT 6% for human sunscreen use.",

        abstract: "The potential human health risk of UV filters depends on their toxicity and the human systemic exposure which is a function of the extent of percutaneous absorption of the topically applied substance into the human organism. Using a 'mass balance' approach, a study was designed to investigate the systemically absorbed dose of [(14)C]-Mexoryl SX((R)) in humans after topical application of a typical sunscreen emulsion. In addition, to assess the correlation with in vitro experiments, the percutaneous absorption of this UVA filter through isolated human skin was measured under identical exposure conditions. When applied in vivo for a period of 4 h, 89-94% of the applied radioactivity was recovered from the wash-off samples. In urine samples, the radioactivity slightly exceeded background levels and corresponded maximally to 0.014% of the topically applied dose. No radioactivity was measured in blood or faeces sampled up to 120 h after application. In vitro, 24 h after a 4-hour application, [(14)C]-Mexoryl SX remained primarily on the skin surface. The mean in vitro absorption over 24 h, adding up the amounts found in the dermis and receptor fluid, was 0.16% of the applied dose. It is concluded from the in vivo pharmacokinetic results that the systemically absorbed dose of [(14)C]-Mexoryl SX is less than 0.1%. The order of magnitude of this value correlates well with the corresponding in vitro data which overestimate the in vivo results as previously observed with other hydrophilic compounds. This study demonstrates that, under realistic exposure conditions, the human systemic exposure to this UVA filter is negligible and poses no risk to human health.",

        abstract: "We have previously shown that skin reconstructed in vitro is a useful model to study the effects of UVB and UVA exposure. Wavelength-specific biological damage has been identified such as the formation of sunburn cells (SBC) and pyrimidine dimers after UVB irradiation and alterations of dermal fibroblasts after UVA exposure. These specific effects were selected to evaluate the protection afforded by two sunscreens after topical application on the skin surface. Simplified formulations having different absorption spectra but similar sun protection factors were used. One contained a classical UVB absorber, 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate. The other contained a broad-spectrum absorber called Mexoryl SX, characterized by its strong absorbing potency in the UVA range. Both filters were used at 5% in a simple water/oil vehicle. The evaluation of photoprotection on in vitro reconstructed skin revealed good efficiency for both preparations in preventing UVB-induced damage, as shown by SBC counting and pyrimidine dimer immunostaining. By contrast, only the Mexoryl SX-containing preparation was able to efficiently prevent UVA-specific damage such as dermal fibroblast disappearance. Our data further support the fact that skin reconstructed in vitro is a reliable system to evaluate the photoprotection provided by different sunscreens against specific UVB and UVA biological damage.",

        title: "Sunscreens.",
        abstract: "Sunscreens have become since more than 40 years the most popular means of protection against UV radiation (UVR) in Western countries. Organic and inorganic filters with different absorption spectrum exist. They filter or scatter UVR. Protection from UVB is quantified as a minimal erythema dose-based sun protection factor. UVA protection testing is less standardized: Persistent pigment darkening and critical wavelength are currently used methods. Marketing and labeling of sunscreens underlay national regulation which explains major differences between the European and the US sunscreen market. Sunscreens are most performing in sunburn prevention. Broad spectrum UVB and UVA protection and regular application in sufficient amounts are essential for prevention of skin cancers, UV-induced immunosuppression, and skin aging. A significant benefit from regular sunscreen use has not yet been demonstrated for primary prevention of basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Concerning the prevention of actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinomas, and skin aging, the effect of sunscreens is significant, but it remains incomplete. Some organic UV filters (PABA derivatives, cinnamates, benzophenones, and octocrylene) have been described to cause photoallergy. Percutaneous absorption and endocrine disrupting activity of small-sized organic and nano-sized inorganic UV filters have been reported. On lesional skin and in pediatric settings, these products should be used with caution. Cutaneous vitamin D synthesis depending on skin-carcinogenic UVB radiation, the potential risk of vitamin D deficiency by sunscreen use has become a major subject of public health debate. Sunscreens indeed impair vitamin D synthesis if they are used in the recommended amount of 2 mg/cm2, but not in lesser thickness below 1.5 mg/cm2 that corresponds better to what users apply in real life conditions. Large molecular last generation UVB-UVA broad spectrum sunscreens have a better benefit-risk ratio than former organic filters: They offer better protection in the UVA band, they are non toxic and non allergenic. A better outcome of sunscreen efficacy especially in primary skin cancer prevention may be achieved with these molecules.",

        abstract: "Transformation products (TPs) of micropollutants contaminating our water resources have become an emerging issue due to the potential threats they pose to environmental and human health. This study investigated the transformation chemistry, toxicity, physicochemical properties and environmental behavior resulting from photocatalytic transformation of organic UV filters as model micropollutants. 3-Benzylidene camphor (3-BC), 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-HB) and octocrylene (OC) were effectively degraded by UV-A/TiO<sub>2</sub> treatment, with TPs identified and characterized with high resolution mass spectrometry. Nitrated-TPs were observed to be formed in the presence of nitrite and nitrate for 3-BC and 4-HB, suggesting that the transformation process could be altered by components in the water matrix. Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition assay revealed an increase in toxicity of TPs derived from photocatalytic treatment, with quantitative structure-activity relationship model (ECOSAR) predicted an enhanced toxicity of individual TPs' after transformation. Assessment of physicochemical properties and environmental behavior suggested that TPs as compared to parent organic UV filters, may represent even greater hazards due to their increased water solubility, persistence and mobility - in addition to retaining the parent organic UV filter's toxicity. The results provide important information relevant to the potential risks for the selected organic UV filters, and their corresponding transformation products.",

        abstract: "Octocrylene (OC) is a broad-spectrum ultraviolet-absorbing chemical used in sunscreen and other personal care products. Its health effects are a concern because it has been detected in water, fish, humans, and food chains. In vivo and in vitro investigations were performed in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae and a zebrafish liver cell line (ZFL), respectively, to understand the potential risks and molecular mechanisms of OC toxicity. The 96-h median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) of OC was determined to be 251.8 μM in larvae and 5.5 μM in ZFL cells. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that OC induced the expression of genes for CYPs (CYP1A, CYP3A65), estrogen receptors (ERα, ERβ1, GPER), vitellogenin (VTG1), and sex determination (BRCA2, CYP19A, DMRT1, SOX9A), both in vitro and in vivo. A whole-transcriptome sequencing method was used to evaluate the gene expression profile of larvae exposed to OC. OC was found to mediate the biosynthesis of estrogens (such as estriol) and affect the antioxidant pathway (glutathione transferases and peroxisome). These findings clarify the toxic effects and molecular mechanisms of OC and support banning its use in cosmetics.",

        abstract: "Organic Ultraviolet Filters (OUVFs), commonly used in sunscreens, cosmetics and industrial products to prevent ultraviolet radiation damage, are increasingly detected in the environment due to their widespread use and persistence. This has raised concerns over their toxicity and environmental impact, leading to the classification of OUVF 2-(2H-Benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-ditertpentylphenol (UV-328) as a persistent organic pollutant under the Stockholm Convention in 2023. In this review, current knowledge on the usage, discharge and environmental contamination of OUVFs is briefly discussed. The available analytical methodologies are also reviewed, especially for the extraction and detection of OUVFs in different matrix samples. Finally, the reported levels of OUVFs pollution in surface water, drinking water, aquatic organisms and human urine worldwide are discussed, along with their potential implications for ecological and human health. In general, typical OUVFs ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC) and Octocrylene (OC) have been shown to pose a significant potential risks in the surface waters of multiple countries such as Australia, China, Japan, the United States. Furthermore, while the OUVFs exposure concentrations in drinking water are generally low (below detection limit to 450 ng/L), prolonged exposure may still present potential health risks for humans.",

The developed sunscreen composition contains defined concentration of herbal extracts and octocrylene were evaluated for their different physicochemical properties and stability. Sun protection factor boosting effect of herbal extracts is studied combination with octocrylene. Invitro SPF studied for herbal extract individually and combination with octocrylene. The results of Invitro SPF study revealed the presence of green tea extract and, Eclipta prostrata (bhringraj) leaf extract shows excellent sun protection factor (SPF) boosting value of sunscreen composition containing 5% concentration of herbal extract and octocrylene. The sunscreen formulation containing 5% herbal extracts are stable for 12 weeks in an oven (45 °C). The findings of this in-vitro SPF study revealed a sun protection boosting capacity of green tea extract and bhringraj extract confirmed. The over exposure of human skin to Ultra-Violet Radiation (UVR) can trigger photodamage, UV burn, pigmentation, erythema, and enhance the chance of dermal carcinoma. UVR causes DNA damage, which leads to dermal cancer. Daily sunscreens protect the skin from the adverse effects of sun rays, especially UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA (320-400 nm). The ozone layer filters UVC (200-290 nm) radiation when it enters into atmosphere of the earth. UVB causes sunburn, photo damage and cause mutagenic changes in nucleic acids. UVA increases ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) accumulation. ROS is responsible for cell repair which leads to carcinogenesis, and the cause of photodamage. Herbal extracts contain polyphenols, and flavonoids act as a natural sunscreen that will filter Ultra-Violet (UVB) light and contain antioxidant characteristics to modulate the photo-oxidative damage that results from UV-induced Reactive Oxygen Species production. The UVR protection of most herbal extracts are required to attain the higher UV protection in the sun care products.

Although commercial sunscreens can protect skin from UV-induced damage to an extent, the side effects caused by such products are still worrisome. Here, inspired by the natural photoprotection effect of human hair, we extracted the multifunctional particles from human hair as sunscreens for UV protection. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> results indicate that hair-derived particles (HDPs) could effectively protect skin from UV radiation. Besides, HDPs retain the antioxidant capability of melanin in hair, which avoids UV-induced oxidative damage. In addition, the unique shape of HDPs can prevent them from penetrating into the skin, thus avoiding potential toxicity. Moreover, owing to their mesoporous structure, the particles can also be used as drug carriers. With the loading of octocrylene, the particles are more effective in blocking UV radiation. This study provides an ingenious tactic for the design and development of sunscreens from a natural substance.",

Extraction method parameters were optimized: 250 ml of water sample loaded on Chromabond C18 cartridges after adjustment to pH 4 and then eluted with acetonitrile. The mobile phase and the parameters of the mass spectrometer, as well as those of the ionization source, were tested to enhance detection sensitivity. During method validation, the extracted target compounds showed good recoveries (> 68%) with acceptable values in terms of repeatability (RSD<sub>r</sub>) and reproducibility (RSD<sub>R</sub>), where relative standard deviations values were lower than 20%. The validated method was applied to 10 water samples collected from different swimming pools located in Lebanon from which eight UV filters among the eighteen targets compounds were detected at concentrations ranged between 1 and 2526 µg L<sup>-1</sup>. The most detected compounds were padimate-O (OD-PABA) and octocrylene (OCR).

        abstract: "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder manifesting with symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism, and/or polycystic ovaries. The exact cause of PCOS remains unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic predisposition, insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation, and excessive androgen production. Various environmental factors, especially endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), in addition to genetic and hormonal ones, also may influence PCOS. This is one of the first systematic reviews dealing with the exposure to non-persistent endocrine disrupting chemicals and PCOS. The review summarizes the existing knowledge about the association of EDCs with PCOS based on significant findings on the toxicity of various non-persistent environmental EDCs and polycyclic ovarian syndrome risk. A systematic search of the literature was conducted in order to identify proper studies using PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier, and Springer databases. The results of the studies suggest that there is a positive association between bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, octocrylene, and PCOS. The data concerning triclosan and PCOS were inconclusive. Additionally, no link between the exposures to parabens and PCOS was observed. These results of the presented studies highlight the urgent need for continued research on EDCs and their role in PCOS.

The determination of PBT properties is a complex task given the magnitude of chemicals, thus it is necessary to have a tool to quickly screen and prioritize the most important compounds.

In the present study, several organic compounds present in the PCPs viz. body lotion, sunscreens, moisturizers, hair dyes, and some hair care products were identified and their PBT property was estimated. The results from the study indicate that the order of increasing occurrence of PBT chemicals is sunscreens > moisturizers > body lotion > hair care products > hair dyes. The prioritized compounds were given rank 1 (maximum concern) to rank 4 (minimum concern). From the results, the compounds octocrylene in sunscreens and butylphenyl methylpropional in body lotions were prioritized as Rank 1.",
