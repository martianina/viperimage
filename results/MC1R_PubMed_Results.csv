23749111,UV radiation and the skin.,"UV radiation (UV) is classified as a ""complete carcinogen"" because it is both a mutagen and a non-specific damaging agent and has properties of both a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter. In environmental abundance, UV is the most important modifiable risk factor for skin cancer and many other environmentally-influenced skin disorders. However, UV also benefits human health by mediating natural synthesis of vitamin D and endorphins in the skin, therefore UV has complex and mixed effects on human health. Nonetheless, excessive exposure to UV carries profound health risks, including atrophy, pigmentary changes, wrinkling and malignancy. UV is epidemiologically and molecularly linked to the three most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, which together affect more than a million Americans annually. Genetic factors also influence risk of UV-mediated skin disease. Polymorphisms of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene, in particular, correlate with fairness of skin, UV sensitivity, and enhanced cancer risk. We are interested in developing UV-protective approaches based on a detailed understanding of molecular events that occur after UV exposure, focusing particularly on epidermal melanization and the role of the MC1R in genome maintenance.","D'Orazio John, Jarrett Stuart, Amaro-Ortiz Alexandra, Scott Timothy",International journal of molecular sciences,2013,"Animals, Humans, Melanins, Oxidative Stress, Skin, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23749111/,"Graduate Center for Toxicology and the Departments of Pediatrics, Biomedical and Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, 800 Rose Street, Lexington, KY 40536, USA. jdorazio@uky.edu."
32249949,Germline mutations predisposing to melanoma.,"Nearly 15% of melanomas occur in patients with a family history and a subset of these patients have a germline mutation in a melanoma predisposing gene. CDKN2A mutations are responsible for the majority of hereditary melanoma, but many other susceptibility genes have been discovered in recent years, including CDK4, TERT, ACD, TERF2IP, POT1, MITF, MC1R, and BAP1. Additionally, melanoma risk is increased in mixed cancer syndromes caused by mutations in PTEN, BRCA2, BRCA1, RB1, and TP53. While early onset, multiple tumors, and family cancer history remain the most valuable clinical clues for hereditary melanoma, characteristic epithelioid cytology of melanocytic tumors may suggest an underlying BAP1 mutation. Herein, we review the clinical and histopathologic characteristics of melanocytic tumors associated with these germline mutations and discuss the role of genetic counseling.","Toussi Atrin, Mans Nicole, Welborn Jeanna, Kiuru Maija",Journal of cutaneous pathology,2020,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16, Genes, p16, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Germ-Line Mutation, Humans, Melanoma, Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor, Middle Aged, Nevus, Pigmented, Phenotype, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Shelterin Complex, Telomerase, Telomere-Binding Proteins, Tumor Suppressor Proteins, Ubiquitin Thiolesterase, Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32249949/,"Department of Dermatology, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California, USA.; Hereditary Cancer Program, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California, USA."
29124692,Ultraviolet Radiations: Skin Defense-Damage Mechanism.,"UV-radiations are the invisible part of light spectra having a wavelength between visible rays and X-rays. Based on wavelength, UV rays are subdivided into UV-A (320-400 nm), UV-B (280-320 nm) and UV-C (200-280 nm). Ultraviolet rays can have both harmful and beneficial effects. UV-C has the property of ionization thus acting as a strong mutagen, which can cause immune-mediated disease and cancer in adverse cases. Numbers of genetic factors have been identified in human involved in inducing skin cancer from UV-radiations. Certain heredity diseases have been found susceptible to UV-induced skin cancer. UV radiations activate the cutaneous immune system, which led to an inflammatory response by different mechanisms. The first line of defense mechanism against UV radiation is melanin (an epidermal pigment), and UV absorbing pigment of skin, which dissipate UV radiation as heat. Cell surface death receptor (e.g. Fas) of keratinocytes responds to UV-induced injury and elicits apoptosis to avoid malignant transformation. In addition to the formation of photo-dimers in the genome, UV also can induce mutation by generating ROS and nucleotides are highly susceptible to these free radical injuries. Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) has been known to be implicated in different UV-induced damages such as pigmentation, adaptive tanning, and skin cancer. UV-B induces the formation of pre-vitamin D3 in the epidermal layer of skin. UV-induced tans act as a photoprotection by providing a sun protection factor (SPF) of 3-4 and epidermal hyperplasia. There is a need to prevent the harmful effects and harness the useful effects of UV radiations.","Mohania Dheeraj, Chandel Shikha, Kumar Parveen, Verma Vivek, Digvijay Kumar, Tripathi Deepika, Choudhury Khushboo, Mitten Sandeep Kumar, Shah Dilip",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2017,"Animals, Apoptosis, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Humans, Keratinocytes, Melanins, Melanoma, Mutagenesis, Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced, Radiodermatitis, Signal Transduction, Skin, Skin Neoplasms, Ultraviolet Rays, fas Receptor",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29124692/,"Department of Neurology, PGIMER, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, India.; Department of Research, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH), New Delhi, India.; Dr. B.R.

38251461,Identifying actionable druggable targets for breast cancer: Mendelian randomization and population-based analyses.,"Drug repurposing provides a cost-effective approach to address the need for breast cancer prevention and therapeutics. We aimed to identify actionable druggable targets using Mendelian randomization (MR) and then validate the candidate drugs using population-based analyses. We identified genetic instruments for 1406 actionable targets of approved non-oncological drugs based on gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTL, and pQTL, respectively). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (122,977 cases, 105,974 controls). We further conducted a nested case-control study using data retrieved from Swedish registers to validate the candidate drugs that were identified from MR analyses. We identified six significant MR associations with gene expression levels (TUBB, MDM2, CSK, ULK3, MC1R and KCNN4) and two significant associations with gene methylation levels across 21 CpG islands (RPS23 and MAPT). Results from the nested case-control study showed that the use of raloxifene (targeting MAPT) was associated with 35% reduced breast cancer risk (odds ratio, OR, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.51-0.83). However, usage of estradiol, tolterodine, and nitrofurantoin (also targeting MAPT) was associated with increased breast cancer risk, with adjusted ORs and 95% CI of 1.10 (1.07-1.13), 1.16 (1.09-1.24), and 1.09 (1.05-1.13), respectively. The effect of raloxifene and nitrofurantoin lost significance in further validation analyses using active-comparator and new-user design. This large-scale MR analysis, combined with population-based validation, identified eight druggable target genes for breast cancer and suggested that raloxifene is an effective chemoprevention against breast cancer.

32346746,Melanoma Genomics.,"The incidence of cutaneous melanoma continues to increase in pale skinned peoples in Europe and elsewhere. Epidemiological studies identified genetically determined phenotypes such as pale skin, freckles and red hair, and sunburn as risk factors for this cancer. The development of many melanocytic naevi is also genetically determined and a strong melanoma risk phenotype. Not surprisingly then, genome wide association studies have identified pigmentation genes as common risk genes, and to a lesser extent, genes associated with melanocytic naevi. More unexpectedly, genes associated with telomere length have also been identified as risk genes. Higher risk susceptibility genes have been identified, particularly CDKN2A as the most common cause, and very rarely genes such as CDK4, POT1, TERT and other genes in coding for proteins in the shelterin complex are found to be mutated. Familial melanoma genes are associated with an increased number of melanocytic naevi but not invariably and the atypical naevus phenotype is therefore an imperfect marker of gene carrier status. At a somatic level, the most common driver mutation is BRAF, second most common NRAS, third NF1 and increasing numbers of additional rarer mutations are being identified such as in TP53. It is of note that the BRAF and NRAS mutations are not C>T accepted as characteristic of ultraviolet light induced mutations.","Newton-Bishop Julia, Bishop D Timothy, Harland Mark",Acta dermato-venereologica,2020,"Biomarkers, Tumor, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genomics, Heredity, Humans, Incidence, Melanoma, Mutation, Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced, Pedigree, Phenotype, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Skin Neoplasms, Sunlight, Telomere, Telomere Shortening, White People",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32346746/,
22670867,Piebaldism.,"Piebaldism is an uncommon autosomal dominantly inherited pigment anomaly characterized by a congenital white forelock and leukoderma on the frontal scalp, forehead, ventral trunk and extremities. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the KIT gene. Genetic analyses reveal a consistent genotype-phenotype relationship in piebaldism. However, recently reported cases of piebaldism that are milder or severer than genetically expected indicate that other factors, such as a modifier gene of MC1R, influence skin and hair color. The KIT ligand/KIT that triggers the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway play essential functions in the migration, proliferation, survival, melanogenesis and melanosome transfer of the melanocytes. We summarize current research progress in piebaldism and related disorders.","Oiso Naoki, Fukai Kazuyoshi, Kawada Akira, Suzuki Tamio",The Journal of dermatology,2013,"Diagnosis, Differential, Genes, Modifier, Genotype, Humans, Phenotype, Piebaldism, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22670867/,"Department of Dermatology, Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Osakasayama, Japan. naoiso@med.kindai.ac.jp"
30585306,The Melanocortin 1 receptor and its influence on naevi and melanoma in dark-skinned phenotypes.,"It is well appreciated that melanocortin 1 receptor variants can produce a fair skinned and red-haired phenotype that has a strong association with increased melanoma risk. These patients are easily recognised and given appropriate attention. What may not be appreciated is that darker-skinned individuals may also carry melanocortin 1 receptor variant alleles and that they can also be at increased risk of melanoma. Considering that melanocortin 1 receptor is crucial for melanocyte proliferation, regulation and differentiation do the naevi of these darker-skinned individuals have specific features that help identify them as carrying one of these melanocortin 1 receptor variants and do melanomas that develop in dark-skinned melanocortin 1 receptor variant carriers have particular characteristics?",Smith David John Mackay,The Australasian journal of dermatology,2019,"DNA Damage, DNA Repair, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Variation, Hair Color, Humans, Melanoma, Nevus, Phenotype, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30585306/,"University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."
28259754,MC1R signaling. Intracellular partners and pathophysiological implications.,"The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) preferentially expressed in melanocytes is best known as a key regulator of the synthesis of epidermal melanin pigments. Its paracrine stimulation by keratinocyte-derived melanocortins also activates DNA repair pathways and antioxidant defenses to build a complex, multifaceted photoprotective response. Many MC1R actions rely on cAMP-dependent activation of two transcription factors, MITF and PGC1α, but pleiotropic MC1R signaling also involves activation of mitogen-activated kinases and AKT. MC1R partners such as β-arrestins, PTEN and the E3 ubiquitin ligase MGRN1 differentially regulate these pathways. The MC1R gene is complex and polymorphic, with frequent variants associated with skin phenotypes and increased cancer risk. We review current knowledge of signaling from canonical MC1R, its splice isoforms and natural polymorphic variants. Recently discovered intracellular targets and partners are also discussed, to highlight the diversity of mechanisms that may contribute to normal and pathological variation of pigmentation and sensitivity to solar radiation-induced damage.

28024137,[Secrets of the red-headed].,"Only 1-2% of people is red-headed but in the Russian Udmurt Republic or United Kingdom they can be met more often. A specific variant of MC1R gene (R allele) is responsible for the red hair. The gene encodes a receptor for melanocortins. These substances stimulate melanocytes to product melanin- a dye of the skin which is transported to keratinocytes. It protects a cellular nucleus from ultraviolet radiation. Melanin has two types: eumelanin which is dark brown or even black and red/orange pheomelanin. The second one is mostly observed in red-headed which is caused by R allele. The DNA damage occurs more easily because of worse protecting ability of pheomelanin. Moreover this allele is connected with inefficient DNA repair. People with R allele have not only flaming red hairstyle but also very fair skin (often with freckles) and blue eyes. Unfortunately this phenotype is more exposed to harmful effects of UV rays. It means that too extensive exposition to solar light leads to sunburn and development of cancerous skin diseases with melanoma as the worst. R allele is a recessive variant of the gene so only in homozygous persons this characteristic phenotype is observed. Nevertheless blond- or auburn-haired carriers of this allele are also more prone to develop carcinomas. The red-headed also differ from the others in sensitivity to anaesthetics, what is shown by increased MAC. On the other hand these persons less often suffer from vitamin D deficiency. The aim of the article is to present facts and myths of red-headed.","Zdrojewicz Zygmunt, Kowalik Małgorzata, Jagodziński Adam",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,2016,"Alleles, Eye Color, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Hair Color, Humans, Melanins, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin Neoplasms, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28024137/,"Medical University of Wrocław Poland: Faculty of Postgraduate Medical Training, Department and Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Isotope Therapy, Faculty of Medicine.; Medical University of Wrocław Poland: Students of Medical Faculty."
28463841,Skin Pigmentation Genetics for the Clinic.,"Human pigmentation characteristics play an important role in the effects of sun exposure, skin cancer induction and disease outcomes. Several of the genes most important for this diversity are involved in the regulation and distribution of melanin pigmentation or enzymes involved in melanogenesis itself within the melanocyte cell present in the skin, hair and eyes. The single nucleotide polymorphisms and extended haplotypes within or surrounding these genes have been identified as risk factors for skin cancer, in particular, melanoma. These same polymorphisms have been under selective pressure leading towards lighter pigmentation in Europeans in the last 5,000-20,000 years that have driven the increase in frequency in modern populations. Although pigmentation is a polygenic trait, due to interactive and quantitative gene effects, strong phenotypic associations are readily apparent for these major genes. However, predictive value and utility are increased when considering gene polymorphism interactions. In melanoma, an increased penetrance is found in cases when pigmentation gene risk alleles such as MC1R variants are coincident with mutation of higher-risk melanoma genes including CDKN2A, CDK4 and MITF E318K, demonstrating an interface between the pathways for pigmentation, naevogenesis and melanoma. The clinical phenotypes associated with germline changes in pigmentation and naevogenic genes must be understood by clinicians, and will be of increasing relevance to dermatologists, as genomics is incorporated into the delivery of personalised medicine.","Ainger Stephen A, Jagirdar Kasturee, Lee Katie J, Soyer H Peter, Sturm Richard A","Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland)",2017,"Agouti Signaling Protein, Albinism, Antigens, Neoplasm, Antiporters, Biological Evolution, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18, Group VI Phospholipases A2, Hair Color, Humans, Interferon Regulatory Factors, Intramolecular Oxidoreductases, Melanoma, Membrane Glycoproteins, Membrane Transport Proteins, Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor, Monophenol Monooxygenase, Nevus, Oxidoreductases, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Stem Cell Factor",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28463841/,"Dermatology Research Centre, The University of Queensland, Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia."
20066389,Predictive testing of the melanocortin 1 receptor for skin cancer and photoaging.,"Genetic predisposition to melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer extends far beyond the Fitzpatrick phenotype classification scheme. Specific alleles of the gene that codes for the malnocortin 1 receptor are predictive of skin cancer risk independent of skin type and hair color. The ability to identify high risk patients independent of the red hair phenotype may help to modify routine sun and skin monitoring behaviors. In addition, as this increased skin cancer risk is likely due to impaired UVA and UVB defence mechanisms, consideration of genetic predisposition may also be appropriate for patients undergoing psoralen + UVA (PUVA) or UVB treatments for various cutaneous disorders, such as psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo. Testing aimed at improving prognostication may serve to limit the influence of certain risk factors.","Lynde C W, Sapra S",Skin therapy letter,2010,"Alleles, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Testing, Hair Color, Humans, Melanoma, Phenotype, Predictive Value of Tests, Receptors, Melanocortin, Risk Factors, Skin Aging, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20066389/,"Division of Dermatology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."
34356109,Behind the Scene: Exploiting MC1R in Skin Cancer Risk and Prevention.,"Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most frequent cancers of the skin in white populations. An increased risk in the development of skin cancers has been associated with the combination of several environmental factors (i.e., ultraviolet exposure) and genetic background, including melanocortin-1 receptor (<i>MC1R</i>) status. In the last few years, advances in the diagnosis of skin cancers provided a great impact on clinical practice. Despite these advances, NMSCs are still the most common malignancy in humans and melanoma still shows a rising incidence and a poor prognosis when diagnosed at an advanced stage. Efforts are required to underlie the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of melanoma and NMSCs, leading to an optimization of the management of affected patients. The clinical implications of the impact of germline <i>MC1R</i> variants in melanoma and NMSCs' risk, together with the additional risk conferred by somatic mutations in other peculiar genes, as well as the role of <i>MC1R</i> screening in skin cancers' prevention will be addressed in the current review.","Manganelli Michele, Guida Stefania, Ferretta Anna, Pellacani Giovanni, Porcelli Letizia, Azzariti Amalia, Guida Gabriella",Genes,2021,"Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Melanoma, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Risk Factors, Skin, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Physiological Phenomena",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34356109/,"Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neurosciences and Sense Organs, University of Bari-""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy.; Department of Clinical Internal, Anesthesiological and Cardiovascular Sciences, Dermatology Clinic, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy.; Department of Surgical-Medical-Dental and Morphological Science with Interest Transplant-Oncological and Regenerative Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41124 Modena, Italy.; Laboratory of Experimental Pharmacology, IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II, 70124 Bari, Italy."
26892652,Familial skin cancer syndromes: Increased melanoma risk.,"Phenotypic traits, such as red hair and freckling, increase melanoma risk by 2- to 3-fold. In addition, approximately 10% of melanomas are caused by inherited germline mutations that increase melanoma risk from 4- to >1000-fold. This review highlights the key genes responsible for inherited melanoma, with an emphasis on when a patient should undergo genetic testing.

The identification of a surprisingly high number of MC1R natural variants strongly associated with pigmentary phenotypes and increased skin cancer risk has prompted research on the functional properties of the wild-type receptor and frequent mutant alleles.

39117851,Hepatocyte-specific loss of melanocortin 1 receptor disturbs fatty acid metabolism and promotes adipocyte hypertrophy.,"Melanocortins mediate their biological functions via five different melanocortin receptors (MC1R - MC5R). MC1R is expressed in the skin and leukocytes, where it regulates skin pigmentation and inflammatory responses. MC1R is also present in the liver and white adipose tissue, but its functional role in these tissues is unclear. This study aimed at determining the regulatory role of MC1R in fatty acid metabolism. Male recessive yellow (Mc1r<sup>e/e</sup>) mice, a model of global MC1R deficiency, and male hepatocyte-specific MC1R deficient mice (Mc1r LKO) were fed a chow or Western diet for 12 weeks. The mouse models were characterized for body weight and composition, liver adiposity, adipose tissue mass and morphology, glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, qPCR and RNA sequencing analyses were used to investigate gene expression profiles in the liver and adipose tissue. HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes were used to study the effects of pharmacological MC1R activation. Chow- and Western diet-fed Mc1r<sup>e/e</sup> showed increased liver weight, white adipose tissue mass and plasma triglyceride (TG) concentration compared to wild type mice. This phenotype occurred without significant changes in food intake, body weight, physical activity or glucose metabolism. Mc1r LKO mice displayed a similar phenotype characterized by larger fat depots, increased adipocyte hypertrophy and enhanced accumulation of TG in the liver and plasma. In terms of gene expression, markers of de novo lipogenesis, inflammation and apoptosis were upregulated in the liver of Mc1r LKO mice, while enzymes regulating lipolysis were downregulated in white adipose tissue of these mice. In cultured hepatocytes, selective activation of MC1R reduced ChREBP expression, which is a central transcription factor for lipogenesis. Hepatocyte-specific loss of MC1R disturbs fatty acid metabolism in the liver and leads to an obesity phenotype characterized by enhanced adipocyte hypertrophy and TG accumulation in the liver and circulation.","Thapa Keshav, Ghimire Bishwa, Pokharel Kisun, Cai Minying, Savontaus Eriika, Rinne Petteri",International journal of obesity (2005),2024,"Animals, Humans, Male, Mice, Adipocytes, Fatty Acids, Hepatocytes, Hypertrophy, Lipid Metabolism, Liver, Mice, Knockout, Obesity, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39117851/,"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), Jokioinen, Finland.; Research Centre for Integrative Physiology and Pharmacology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.; Research Centre for Integrative Physiology and Pharmacology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. pperin@utu.fi."
25616102,Genetics and nonmelanoma skin cancer in kidney transplant recipients.,"Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) have a 65- to 250-fold greater risk than the general population of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer. Immunosuppressive drugs combined with traditional risk factors such as UV radiation exposure are the main modifiable risk factors for skin cancer development in transplant recipients. Genetic variation affecting immunosuppressive drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has been associated with other transplant complications and may contribute to differences in skin cancer rates between KTRs. Genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding the prednisolone receptor, GST enzyme, MC1R, MTHFR enzyme and COX-2 enzyme have been shown to increase the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in KTRs.

34455851,Effect of Superstitious Beliefs and Risk Intuitions on Genetic Test Decisions.,"Moving beyond numeric representations of risk perceptions, we examine cognitive causation, or superstitious thinking, and negative affect in risk as predictors of <i>MC1R</i> (i.e., moderate v. high risk) skin cancer genetic testing and responses to this testing. Participants (<i>N</i> = 496) completed baseline assessments using validated measures of cognitive causation (beliefs that thinking about cancer risk increases cancer likelihood) and negative affect in risk (negative feelings generated during risk perception) and subsequently received a test offer. Participants could access a website to learn about and request genetic testing. Those who tested (<i>n</i> = 167) completed assessments of cognitive and affective reactions 2 wk after testing, including the Impact of Events-Revised Intrusive thoughts subscale. Those with higher negative affect in risk were less likely to return a saliva sample for testing (odds ratio = 0.98, 95% confidence interval = 0.96-0.99). Those with higher cognitive causation reported more fear (<i>b</i> = 0.28-0.31; <i>P</i>'s < 0.05). Higher negative affect in risk was associated with more emotion-laden test responses, particularly in those receiving higher-risk as compared with average-risk results. Negative affect in risk did not hamper test information seeking, although it did inhibit the uptake of genetic testing. Those with higher cognitive causation showed more fear regarding their test result, as indicated by higher distress in those who received average-risk results and lower believability in those who received higher-risk results.","Riley Kristen E, Sussman Andrew L, Schofield Elizabeth, Guest Dolores D, Dailey Yvonne T, Schwartz Matthew R, Buller David B, Hunley Keith, Kaphingst Kimberly A, Berwick Marianne, Hay Jennifer L",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,2022,"Cognition, Fear, Genetic Testing, Humans, Intuition, Skin Neoplasms",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34455851/,"Klein Buendel, Inc., Golden, CO, USA.; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.; Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.; University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.; University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Center, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."
28676423,Functional interplay between secreted ligands and receptors in melanoma.,"Melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, results from the malignant transformation of melanocytes located in the basement membrane separating the epidermal and dermal skin compartments. Cutaneous melanoma is often initiated by solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced mutations. Melanocytes intimately interact with keratinocytes, which provide growth factors and melanocortin peptides acting as paracrine regulators of proliferation and differentiation. Keratinocyte-derived melanocortins activate melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) to protect melanocytes from the carcinogenic effect of UVR. Accordingly, MC1R is a major determinant of susceptibility to melanoma. Despite extensive phenotypic heterogeneity and high mutation loads, the molecular basis of melanomagenesis and the molecules mediating the crosstalk between melanoma and stromal cells are relatively well understood. Mutations of intracellular effectors of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling, notably NRAS and BRAF, are major driver events more frequent than mutations in RTKs. Nevertheless, melanomas often display aberrant signalling from RTKs such as KIT, ERRB1-4, FGFR, MET and PDGFR, which contribute to disease progression and resistance to targeted therapies. Progress has also been made to unravel the role of the tumour secretome in preparing the metastatic niche. However, key aspects of the melanoma-stroma interplay, such as the molecular determinants of dormancy, remain poorly understood.","Herraiz Cecilia, Jiménez-Cervantes Celia, Sánchez-Laorden Berta, García-Borrón José C",Seminars in cell & developmental biology,2018,"Epidermis, GTP Phosphohydrolases, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Keratinocytes, MAP Kinase Signaling System, Melanocytes, Melanoma, Membrane Proteins, Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin Neoplasms, Ultraviolet Rays, Melanoma, Cutaneous Malignant",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28676423/,"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, University of Murcia, and Instituto Murciano de Investigación Biosanitaria (IMIB), Campus de Ciencias de la Salud, El Palmar, Murcia, Spain.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, University of Murcia, and Instituto Murciano de Investigación Biosanitaria (IMIB), Campus de Ciencias de la Salud, El Palmar, Murcia, Spain.

30798934,cAMP-mediated regulation of melanocyte genomic instability: A melanoma-preventive strategy.,"Malignant melanoma of the skin is the leading cause of death from skin cancer and ranks fifth in cancer incidence among all cancers in the United States. While melanoma mortality has remained steady for the past several decades, melanoma incidence has been increasing, particularly among fair-skinned individuals. According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 10,000 people in the United States will die from melanoma this year. Individuals with dark skin complexion are protected damage generated by UV-light due to the high content of UV-blocking melanin pigment in their epidermis as well as better capacity for melanocytes to cope with UV damage. There is now ample evidence that suggests that the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a major melanoma risk factor. Inherited loss-of-function mutations in MC1R are common in melanoma-prone persons, correlating with a less melanized skin complexion and poorer recovery from mutagenic photodamage. We and others are interested in the MC1R signaling pathway in melanocytes, its mechanisms of enhancing genomic stability and pharmacologic opportunities to reduce melanoma risk based on those insights. In this chapter, we review melanoma risk factors, the MC1R signaling pathway, and the relationship between MC1R signaling and DNA repair.","Holcomb Nathaniel C, Bautista Robert-Marlo, Jarrett Stuart G, Carter Katharine M, Gober Madeline Krentz, D'Orazio John A",Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2019,"Animals, Cyclic AMP, Genomic Instability, Humans, Melanocytes, Melanoma",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30798934/,"The Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States.; The Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States; Department of Surgery, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States.; The Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States; Department of Toxiciology and Cancer Biology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States.; The Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States; Department of Toxiciology and Cancer Biology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States; Department of Pediatrics, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, United States.

11708951,The melanocortin-1 receptor: red hair and beyond.,"Although human pigmentation is genetically complex, to date polymorphism at only 1 locus, the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R), has been associated with physiologic variation in hair and skin color. The MC1-R, a G protein-coupled receptor with 7 transmembrane-spanning domains, plays a key role in determining the type of melanin (eumelanin vs pheomelanin) that is produced within melanocytes. This article begins with an overview of melanocortin receptors, proopiomelanocortin-derived ligands, and the agouti antagonist, with particular focus on their functions in regulating eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesis, including UV-induced melanogenesis. A brief description of mouse-coat-color genetics is then followed by a discussion of human MC1-R variants, which are present in approximately 50% of white populations. We review the increasing evidence that loss-of-function MC1-R mutations largely account for the red hair phenotype in humans (which approximates an autosomal recessive trait) and also have a strong association with fair skin and a decreased ability to tan, with a significant heterozygote effect in individuals without red hair. Finally, we examine recent work showing that loss-of-function MC1-R variants may increase the risk of developing melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer beyond their effects on pigmentation phenotype.","Schaffer J V, Bolognia J L",Archives of dermatology,2001,"Agouti Signaling Protein, Animals, Hair Color, Humans, Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormones, Mice, Polymorphism, Genetic, Pro-Opiomelanocortin, Proteins, Receptors, Corticotropin, Receptors, Melanocortin, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11708951/,"Department of Dermatology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520, USA. votavajr@biomed.med.yale.edu"
25219681,Variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor: do they matter clinically?,"The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene encodes for a seven-pass transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on melanocytes and melanoma cells. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, also termed variants) in MC1R frequently cause red hair, fair skin and are associated with melanoma and keratinocyte-derived skin cancer development. Activation of wild-type (WT) MC1R in skin assists cutaneous photoprotection whereas reduced MC1R signalling, seen with MC1R variants, impairs ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-protective responses. As ancestral humans migrated out of Africa, the evolutionary advantage of MC1R variants may have related to improved cutaneous vitamin D synthesis and higher birthweight reported with certain MC1R variants. Reduced photoprotection secondary to MC1R dysfunction involves pigmentary and non-pigmentary mechanisms (reduced DNA repair, effects on cell proliferation and possibly immunological parameters), leading to clonal expansion of mutated cells within skin and subsequent carcinogenesis. Recent investigations suggest an association between MC1R genotype and vitiligo, with preliminary evidence that a MC1R agonist, [Nle4-D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH, in combination with UVB, assists repigmentation. Future development of compounds to correct defective MC1R responses secondary to MC1R variants could result in photoprotective benefits for fair-skinned individuals and reduce their skin cancer risk.","Haddadeen Ciara, Lai Chester, Cho Shin-Young, Healy Eugene",Experimental dermatology,2015,"Carcinoma, Basal Cell, Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, Genetic Variation, Humans, Light, Melanocytes, Melanoma, Phenotype, Pigmentation, Pigmentation Disorders, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Signal Transduction, Skin, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Ultraviolet Rays, Vitiligo, alpha-MSH",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25219681/,"Dermatopharmacology, Sir Henry Wellcome Laboratories, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK; Dermatology, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK."
35197079,Melanocortin 1 receptor activation protects against alpha-synuclein pathologies in models of Parkinson's disease.,"Epidemiological studies suggest a link between the melanoma-related pigmentation gene melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). We previously showed that MC1R signaling can facilitate nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron survival. The present study investigates the neuroprotective potential of MC1R against neurotoxicity induced by alpha-synuclein (αSyn), a key player in PD genetics and pathogenesis. Nigral dopaminergic neuron toxicity induced by local overexpression of aSyn was assessed in mice that have an inactivating mutation of MC1R, overexpress its wild-type transgene, or were treated with MC1R agonists. The role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in MC1R-mediated protection against αSyn was characterized in vitro. Furthermore, MC1R expression was determined in human postmortem midbrain from patients with PD and unaffected subjects. Targeted expression of αSyn in the nigrostriatal pathway induced exacerbated synuclein pathologies in MC1R mutant mice, which were accompanied by neuroinflammation and altered Nrf2 responses, and reversed by the human MC1R transgene. Two MC1R agonists were neuroprotective against αSyn-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. In vitro experiments showed that Nrf2 was a necessary mediator of MC1R effects. Lastly, MC1R was present in dopaminergic neurons in the human substantia nigra and appeared to be reduced at the tissue level in PD patients. Our study supports an interaction between MC1R and αSyn that can be mediated by neuronal MC1R possibly through Nrf2. It provides evidence for MC1R as a therapeutic target and a rationale for development of MC1R-activating strategies for PD.","Cai Waijiao, Srivastava Pranay, Feng Danielle, Lin Yue, Vanderburg Charles R, Xu Yuehang, Mclean Pamela, Frosch Matthew P, Fisher David E, Schwarzschild Michael A, Chen Xiqun",Molecular neurodegeneration,2022,"Animals, Disease Models, Animal, Dopaminergic Neurons, Humans, Mice, Parkinson Disease, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, alpha-Synuclein",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35197079/,"Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Department of Dermatology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.; MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.; MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA. xchen17@mgh.harvard.edu.; Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA."
12753400,The role of melanocortin-1 receptor polymorphism in skin cancer risk phenotypes.,"We have examined melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) variant allele frequencies in the general population and in a collection of adolescent dizygotic and monozygotic twins to determine statistical associations of pigmentation phenotypes with increased skin cancer risk. This included hair and skin color, freckling, mole count and sun exposed skin reflectance. Nine variants were studied and designated as either strong R (OR = 63; 95% CI 32-140) or weak r (OR = 5; 95% CI 3-11) red hair alleles. Penetrance of each MC1R variant allele was consistent with an allelic model where effects were multiplicative for red hair but additive for skin reflectance. To assess the interaction of the brown eye color gene BEY2/OCA2 on the phenotypic effects of variant MC1R alleles we imputed OCA2 genotype in the twin collection. A modifying effect of OCA2 on MC1R variant alleles was seen on constitutive skin color, freckling and mole count. In order to study the individual effects of these variants on pigmentation phenotype we have established a series of human primary melanocyte strains genotyped for the MC1R receptor. These include strains which are MC1R wild-type consensus, variant heterozygotes, and homozygotes for strong R alleles Arg151Cys and Arg160Trp. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that only consensus strains contained stage III and IV melanosomes in their terminal dendrites whereas Arg151Cys and Arg160Trp homozygous strains contained only immature stage I and II melanosomes. Such genetic association studies combined with the functional analysis of MC1R variant alleles in melanocytic cells should provide a link in understanding the association between pigmentary phototypes and skin cancer risk.","Sturm Richard A, Duffy David L, Box Neil F, Chen Wei, Smit Darren J, Brown Darren L, Stow Jennifer L, Leonard J Helen, Martin Nicholas G",Pigment cell research,2003,"Alleles, Cells, Cultured, Diseases in Twins, Eye Color, Genetic Variation, Genotype, Hair Color, Heterozygote, Homozygote, Humans, Melanocytes, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Risk, Skin Neoplasms, Twins, Dizygotic, Twins, Monozygotic",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12753400/,"Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. r.sturm@imb.uq.edu.au"
33305505,Human TYRP1: Two functions for a single gene?,"In the animal kingdom, skin pigmentation is highly variable between species, and it contributes to phenotypes. In humans, skin pigmentation plays a part in sun protection. Skin pigmentation depends on the ratio of the two pigments pheomelanin and eumelanin, both synthesized by a specialized cell population, the melanocytes. In this review, we explore one important factor in pigmentation: the tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) gene which is involved in eumelanin synthesis via the TYRP1 protein. Counterintuitively, high TYRP1 mRNA expression is associated with a poor clinical outcome for patients with metastatic melanomas. Recently, we were able to explain this unexpected TYRP1 function by demonstrating that TYRP1 mRNA sequesters microRNA-16, a tumor suppressor miRNA. Here, we focus on actors influencing TYRP1 mRNA abundance, particularly transcription factors, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and miRNAs, as they all dictate the indirect oncogenic activity of TYRP1.","Gautron Arthur, Migault Mélodie, Bachelot Laura, Corre Sébastien, Galibert Marie-Dominique, Gilot David",Pigment cell & melanoma research,2021,"Genes, Tumor Suppressor, Humans, Melanocytes, Melanoma, Membrane Glycoproteins, MicroRNAs, Neoplasm Metastasis, Neoplasm Proteins, Oxidoreductases, Skin Pigmentation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33305505/,"CNRS, IGDR (Institut de génétique et développement de Rennes) - UMR 6290, F-35000, Univ.

Here we analyze the MC1R gene in West Maharashtra, India to see if sequence diversity corresponds to their diverse pigmentary profiles and if MC1R is constrained in dark skinned tribal as compared to lighter skinned caste populations. A 2648 bp region of this gene was sequenced in 102 individuals and the data was compared for π, ϴ diversity indices.

Non-synonymous variants rs2228479A, rs1805007_T, and rs885479_A showed low variability in these populations. Selection tests did not indicate any constraint on MC1R and pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> were also low among the study populations (-0.0163 to 0.06112). The SNP rs3212359 was significantly associated with MI measures when tested using different association models. We do not find evidence of a selective constraint on MC1R. The presence of a large number of unique haplotypes and low F<sub>ST</sub> values at this locus suggests that MC1R polymorphisms may not be influencing pigmentation variation among castes and tribes in this region.

33751833,Chemical and biochemical control of skin pigmentation with special emphasis on mixed melanogenesis.,"Melanins are widely distributed in animals and plants; in vertebrates, most melanins are present on the body surface. The diversity of pigmentation in vertebrates is mainly attributed to the quantity and ratio of eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesis. Most natural melanin pigments in animals consist of both eumelanin and pheomelanin in varying ratios, and thus, their combined synthesis is called ""mixed melanogenesis."" Gene expression is an established mechanism for controlling melanin synthesis; however, there are multiple factors that affect melanin synthesis besides gene expression. Due to the differential sensitivity of the eumelanin and pheomelanin synthetic pathways to pH, melanosomal pH likely plays a major role in mixed melanogenesis. Here, we focused on various factors affecting mixed melanogenesis including (1) chemical regulation of melanin synthesis, (2) melanosomal pH regulation during normal melanogenesis and effect on mixed melanogenesis, and (3) mechanisms of melanosomal pH control (proton pumps, channels, transporters, and signaling pathways).","Wakamatsu Kazumasa, Zippin Jonathan H, Ito Shosuke",Pigment cell & melanoma research,2021,"Animals, Cysteine, Humans, Kinetics, Melanins, Melanosomes, Monophenol Monooxygenase, Skin Pigmentation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33751833/,"Department of Dermatology, Joan and Sanford I.

Fair skin and red hair are characterized by a low eumelanin to pheomelanin ratio, and have been associated with increased risk of skin cancer. Cutaneous pigmentation is a complex genetic trait, with more than 120 genes involved in its regulation, among which the melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R) plays a key role. Although a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in pigmentation genes, very few SNPs have been examined in relation to human pigmentary phenotypes and skin cancer risk. Recent GWAS have identified new candidate determinants of pigmentation traits, but MC1R remains the best characterized genetic determinant of human skin and hair pigmentation as well as the more firmly validated low-penetrance skin cancer susceptibility gene. In this review, we will address how the melanocortin system regulates pigmentation, the effect of MC1R variants on the physiologic function of the MC1 receptor, and how specific MC1R variants are associated with distinct human pigmentation phenotypes.","Dessinioti Clio, Antoniou Christina, Katsambas Andreas, Stratigos Alexander J",Photochemistry and photobiology,2011,"Animals, Genes, Regulator, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Hair, Hair Color, Humans, Melanins, Melanocytes, Mice, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Protein Isoforms, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21749400/,"1st Department of Dermatology, University of Athens, Andreas Sygros Hospital, Athens, Greece. cliodes@hotmail.com"
29968341,Hierarchical modeling of melanocortin 1 receptor variants with skin cancer risk.,"The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic among lightly pigmented populations, and several variants in the MC1R gene have been associated with increased risk of both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers. The functional consequences of MC1R gene variants have been studied in vitro and in vivo in postulated causal pathways, such as G-protein-coupled signaling transduction, pigmentation, immune response, inflammatory response, cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix adhesion. In a case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study, we utilized hierarchical modeling approaches, incorporating quantitative information from these functional studies, to examine the association between particular MC1R alleles and the risk of skin cancers. Different prior matrices were constructed according to the phenotypic associations in controls, cell surface expression, and enzymatic kinetics. Our results showed the parameter variance estimates of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were smaller when using a hierarchical modeling approach compared to standard multivariable regression. Estimates of second-level parameters gave information about the relative importance of MC1R effects on different pathways, and odds ratio estimates changed depending on prior models (e.g., the change ranged from -21% to 7% for melanoma risk assessment). In addition, the estimates of prior model hyperparameters in the hierarchical modeling approach allow us to determine the relevance of individual pathways on the risk of each of the skin cancer types. In conclusion, hierarchical modeling provides a useful analytic approach in addition to the widely used conventional models in genetic association studies that can incorporate measures of allelic function.","Joshi Amit D, Li Xin, Kraft Peter, Han Jiali",Genetic epidemiology,2018,"Adult, Case-Control Studies, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Middle Aged, Models, Genetic, Multivariate Analysis, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Risk Factors, Skin Neoplasms",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29968341/,"Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

35955479,Implication of Melanocortin Receptor Genes in the Familial Comorbidity of Type 2 Diabetes and Depression.,"The melanocortin receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors, which are essential components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and they mediate the actions of melanocortins (melanocyte-stimulating hormones: α-MSH, β-MSH, and γ-MSH) as well as the adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) in skin pigmentation, adrenal steroidogenesis, and stress response. Three melanocortin receptor genes (<i>MC1R</i>, <i>MC2R</i>, and <i>MC5R</i>) contribute to the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD), and one melanocortin receptor gene (<i>MC4R</i>) contributes to the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). MDD increases T2D risk in drug-naïve patients; thus, MDD and T2D commonly coexist. The five melanocortin receptor genes might confer risk for both disorders. However, they have never been investigated jointly to evaluate their potential contributing roles in the MDD-T2D comorbidity, specifically within families. In 212 Italian families with T2D and MDD, we tested 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <i>MC1R</i> gene, 9 SNPs in <i>MC2R</i>, 3 SNPs in <i>MC3R</i>, 4 SNPs in <i>MC4R</i>, and 2 SNPs in <i>MC5R</i>. The testing used 2-point parametric linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD) (i.e., association) analysis with four models (dominant with complete penetrance (D1), dominant with incomplete penetrance (D2), recessive with complete penetrance (R1), and recessive with incomplete penetrance (R2)). We detected significant (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) linkage and/or LD (i.e., association) to/with MDD for one SNP in <i>MC2R</i> (rs111734014) and one SNP in <i>MC5R</i> (rs2236700), and to/with T2D for three SNPs in <i>MC1R</i> (rs1805007 and rs201192930, and rs2228479), one SNP in <i>MC2R</i> (rs104894660), two SNPs in <i>MC3R</i> (rs3746619 and rs3827103), and one SNP in <i>MC4R</i> genes (Chr18-60372302). The linkage/LD/association was significant across different linkage patterns and different modes of inheritance. All reported variants are novel in MDD and T2D. This is the first study to report risk variants in <i>MC1R</i>, <i>MC2R</i>, and <i>MC3R</i> genes in T2D. <i>MC2R</i> and <i>MC5R</i> genes are replicated in MDD, with one novel variant each. Within our dataset, only the <i>MC2R</i> gene appears to confer risk for both MDD and T2D, albeit with different risk variants.

The coding sequence is highly polymorphic in human populations, with several of these variant forms of the receptor now known to be associated with the RHC phenotype. We have examined variant allele frequencies in the general population and in a collection of adolescent dizygotic and monozygotic twins with defined pigmentation characteristics. Variant allele frequencies have also been determined in several case-control studies of sporadic melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and in familial melanoma kindreds collected within Australia. These studies have shown that three RHC alleles - Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp and Asp294His - were associated with increased risk in all forms of skin cancer and with penetrance and age of onset in familial melanoma in mutation carriers. There is a significant RHC allele heterozygote carrier effect on skin phototype and skin cancer risk, which indicates that variant alleles do not behave in a strictly recessive manner.

17147521,Red hair--a desirable mutation?,"Red hair is one of the most striking variants of human hair coloration and has historically been of profound social importance. Red hair in man is due to certain loss of function mutations of one of the peptide products of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R, MIM 155555). Such functional mutations enable the melanocyte to produce red-yellow pheomelanin in preference to the default, black-brown eumelanin. This paper reviews the path of discovery of the MC1R in control of animal coat colour, the subsequent role of MC1R in human physiology and possibly wider role of MC1R in human skin carcinogenesis and human development through history.","Ha Thomas, Rees Jonathan L",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,2002,"Animals, Hair Color, Humans, Mutation, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17147521/,"Department of Dermatology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.

18370847,Genetic mutations that prevent pain: implications for future pain medication.,"Part of the interindividual variability in pain therapy has been associated with genetic polymorphisms. Several genetic variants prevent or at least decrease pain in their carriers as compared with carriers of the respective wild-type or common alleles by impeding the generation, transmission and processing of nociceptive information or by increasing the local availability of active analgesics or their pharmacodynamic effects. Complete prevention of pain has so far been seen in six distinct rare hereditary syndromes, namely the 'channelopathy-associated insensitivity to pain', caused by 13 currently identified variants in the SCN9A gene coding for the alpha-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, and five maladies belonging to the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) I-V syndromes, caused by various mutations in several genes. Reduced pain in the average population has been associated with frequent variants in the micro-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT), guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1/dopa-responsive dystonia gene (GCH1), transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 gene (TRPV1) or the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R). Duplications/amplifications of the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene leading to increased enzyme function may cause intense opioid effects of codeine up to toxicity. The COMT V158M variant has been associated with decreased morphine requirements for analgesia. Inactivating MC1R variants have been associated with increased opioid analgesia of the micro-opioid receptor agonist morphine-6-glucuronide and, in women only, of kappa-opioid agonists. Finally, variants in the P-glycoprotein gene (ABCB1) conferring decreased transporter function have been associated with increased respiratory depressive effects of fentanyl. In summary, a finite number of genetic variants that prevent pain by decreasing nociception or increasing analgesia have been identified. Given the complex biological and psychological nature of pain, we will see in the near future how much of the interindividual variance in pain and analgesia is due to identifiable genetic causes, and to what extent genetics enters clinical pain therapy.","Oertel Bruno, Lötsch Jörn",Pharmacogenomics,2008,"Analgesics, Animals, Genetic Variation, Humans, Mutation, Pain",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18370847/,"Pharmazentrum Frankfurt/ZAFES, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Theodor Stern Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany."
35484177,Identification and validation of prognosis-associated DNA repair gene signatures in colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignant tumor. DNA damage plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis, and abnormal DNA repair pathways affect the occurrence and progression of CRC. In the current study, we aimed to construct a DNA repair-related gene (DRG) signature to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with CRC patients. The differentially expressed DRGs (DE-DRGs) were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The prognostic gene signature was identified by univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier curves and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the underlying biological processes and signaling pathways. ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT were implemented to estimate the tumor immune score and immune cell infiltration status between the different risk group. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was evaluated to representing the drug response of this signature. Nine DE-DRGs (ESCO2, AXIN2, PLK1, CDC25C, IGF1, TREX2, ALKBH2, ESR1 and MC1R) signatures was constructed to classify patients into high- and low-risk groups. The risk score was an independent prognostic indicator of OS (hazard ratio > 1, P < 0.001). The genetic alteration analysis indicated that the nine DE-DRGs in the signature were changed in 63 required samples (100%), and the major alteration was missense mutation. Function enrichment analysis revealed that the immune response and mtotic sister chromatid segregation were the main biological processes. The high-risk group had higher immune score than the low-risk group. What's more, low-risk patients were more sensitive to selumetinib and dasatinib. The nine DE-DRGs signature was significantly associated with OS and provided a new insight for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC.","Song Dingli, Zhang Dai, Chen Sisi, Wu Jie, Hao Qian, Zhao Lili, Ren Hong, Du Ning",Scientific reports,2022,"Acetyltransferases, Biomarkers, Tumor, Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone, Colorectal Neoplasms, DNA Repair, Humans, Kaplan-Meier Estimate, Prognosis",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35484177/,"Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.; Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.; Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710061, Shaanxi, China.; Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710061, Shaanxi, China. andrewdu@126.com.; Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710061, Shaanxi, China. renh_med@163.comcom."
25247900,A review of the role of genetic testing in pain medicine.,"Pain clinicians have always been challenged by the variability of response to pain treatment. Differences in the degree of pain stimulation and pain sensitivity, weight and age differences, prior opioid use and tolerance, as well as the differences in bioavailability of various opioid formulations have been cited as causes for the wide variability in analgesia seen with opioids. Genetics may explain the variability of responses and help to predict more effective (or less dangerous) medication choices and doses. Genetics may also help to predict the response to specific opioids and antidepressants. In this review article, we discuss the genetic influence of nociception, analgesia, and hyoanalgesia. The CYP450 enzymes involved in the metabolism and activity of opioids and adjuvant analgesics are genetically controlled, as are the opioid receptors and a variety of brain chemistries. This article discusses the specific pain implications of genetic variations in CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP3A7, OPRM1, OPRK1, OPRD1, COMT, GABA, UGT, MC1R, GCH1, ABCB1, P-glycoprotein, 5HTR1A, 5HTR2A, MTHFR, CACNA2D2, and 5-HTTLPR. Recent research findings suggest the relationship between genetic predisposition and clinical behavior, including the risk of opioid misuse and addiction. While urine drug testing may hint at genetic issues regarding opioid metabolism, cheek swab DNA testing has become economically viable, and we review the current and future genetic pain issues that may influence the decisions that pain clinicians make every day. Genetic testing may explain and predict many of the clinical responses seen with opioids and adjuvant medications, and may help the clinician identify those patients at genetic risk of opioid misuse and addiction.","Trescot Andrea M, Faynboym Semyon",Pain physician,2014,"Analgesics, Opioid, Genetic Testing, Humans, Opioid-Related Disorders, Pain, Pain Management",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25247900/,"Pain and Headache Center, Wasilla, AK; Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN."
38439523,Genetic insights into Tietz albinism-deafness syndrome: A new dominant-negative mutation in MITF.,"Tietz albinism-deafness syndrome (TADS) is a rare and severe manifestation of Waardenburg syndrome that is primarily linked to mutations in MITF. In this report, we present a case of TADS resulting from a novel c.637G>C mutation in MITF (p.Glu213Gln; GenBank Accession number: NM_000248). A 3-year-old girl presented with congenital generalized hypopigmentation of the hair, skin, and irides along with complete sensorineural hearing loss. Histopathological and electron microscopy investigations indicated that this variant did not alter the number of melanocytes in the skin but significantly impaired melanosome maturation within melanocytes. Comprehensive melanin analysis revealed marked reductions in both eumelanin (EM) and pheomelanin (PM) rather than changes in the EM-to-PM ratio observed in oculocutaneous albinism. We conducted an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to investigate the binding capability of the identified variant to DNA sequences containing the E-box motif along with other known variants (p.Arg217del and p.Glu213Asp). Remarkably, all three variants exhibited dominant-negative effects, thus providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of TADS. This study sheds light on the genetic mechanisms underlying TADS and offers a deeper understanding of this rare condition and its associated mutations in MITF.","Yamamoto Kohei, Okamura Ken, Wakamatsu Kazumasa, Ito Shosuke, Akabane Kozue, Arai Yosuke, Kawaguchi Junnosuke, Hozumi Yutaka, Suzuki Tamio",Pigment cell & melanoma research,2024,"Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Deafness, Genes, Dominant, Melanins, Melanocytes, Melanosomes, Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor, Mutation, Waardenburg Syndrome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38439523/,"Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan.; Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan.; Institute for Melanin Chemistry, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan."
20374726,The melanocortin-1 receptor gene polymorphism and association with human skin cancer.,"The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is a key gene involved in the regulation of melanin synthesis and encodes a G-protein coupled receptor expressed on the surface of the melanocyte in the skin and hair follicles. MC1R activation after ultraviolet radiation exposure results in the production of the dark eumelanin pigment and the tanning process in humans, providing physical protection against DNA damage. The MC1R gene is highly polymorphic in Caucasian populations with a number of MC1R variant alleles associated with red hair, fair skin, freckling, poor tanning, and increased risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. Variant receptors have shown alterations in biochemical function, largely due to intracellular retention or impaired G-protein coupling, but retain some signaling ability. The association of MC1R variant alleles with skin cancer risk remains after correction for pigmentation phenotype, indicating regulation of nonpigmentary pathways. Notably, MC1R activation has been linked to DNA repair and may also contribute to the regulation of immune responses.","Beaumont Kimberley A, Liu Yan Yan, Sturm Richard A",Progress in molecular biology and translational science,2009,"Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Phenotype, Pigmentation, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin Neoplasms",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20374726/,"Melanogenix Group, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia."
21199646,Melanocortin MC₁ receptor in human genetics and model systems.,"The melanocortin MC(1) receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor expressed in the melanocytes of the skin and hair and is known for its key role in the regulation of human pigmentation. Melanocortin MC(1) receptor activation after ultraviolet radiation exposure results in a switch from the red/yellow pheomelanin to the brown/black eumelanin pigment synthesis within cutaneous melanocytes; this pigment is then transferred to the surrounding keratinocytes of the skin. The increase in melanin maturation and uptake results in tanning of the skin, providing a physical protection of skin cells from ultraviolet radiation induced DNA damage. Melanocortin MC(1) receptor polymorphism is widespread within the Caucasian population and some variant alleles are associated with red hair colour, fair skin, poor tanning and increased risk of skin cancer. Here we will discuss the use of mouse coat colour models, human genetic association studies, and in vitro cell culture studies to determine the complex functions of the melanocortin MC(1) receptor and the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between melanocortin MC(1) receptor variant alleles and the red hair colour phenotype. Recent research indicates that melanocortin MC(1) receptor has many non-pigmentary functions, and that the increased risk of skin cancer conferred by melanocortin MC(1) receptor variant alleles is to some extent independent of pigmentation phenotypes. The use of new transgenic mouse models, the study of novel melanocortin MC(1) receptor response genes and the use of more advanced human skin models such as 3D skin reconstruction may provide key elements in understanding the pharmacogenetics of human melanocortin MC(1) receptor polymorphism.","Beaumont Kimberley A, Wong Shu S, Ainger Stephen A, Liu Yan Yan, Patel Mira P, Millhauser Glenn L, Smith Jennifer J, Alewood Paul F, Leonard J Helen, Sturm Richard A",European journal of pharmacology,2011,"Animals, Cell Line, Genotype, Humans, Melanocytes, Melanoma, Phenotype, Pigmentation, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21199646/,"Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane QLD 4072, Australia."
38036989,Association between MC1R gene and coat color segregation in Shanxia long black pig and Lulai black pig.,"Coat color, as a distinct phenotypic characteristic of pigs, is often subject to preference and selection, such as in the breeding process of new breed. Shanxia long black pig was derived from an intercross between Berkshire boars and Licha black pig sows, and it was bred as a paternal strain with high-quality meat and black coat color. Although the coat color was black in the F<sub>1</sub> generation of the intercross, it segregated in the subsequent generations. This study aims to decode the genetic basis of coat color segregation and develop a method to distinct black pigs from the spotted in Shanxia long black pig. Only a QTL was mapped at the proximal end of chromosome 6, and MC1R gene was picked out as functional candidate gene. A total of 11 polymorphic loci were identified in MC1R gene, and only the c.67_68insCC variant was co-segregating with coat color. This locus isn't recognized by any restriction endonuclease, so it can't be genotyped by PCR-RFLP. The c.370G > A polymorphic locus was also significantly associated with coat color, and has been in tightly linkage disequilibrium with the c.67_68insCC. Furthermore, it is recognized by BspHI. Therefore, a PCR-RFLP method was set up to genotype this locus. Besides the 175 sequenced individuals, another more 1,391 pigs were genotyped with PCR-RFLP, and all of pigs with GG (one band) were black. MC1R gene (c.67_68insCC) is the causative gene (mutation) for the coat color segregation, and the PCR-RFLP of c.370G > A could be used in the breeding program of Shanxia long black pig.","Zheng Hao, Xiong San-Ya, Xiao Shi-Jun, Zhang Ze-Kai, Tu Jin-Min, Cui Deng-Shuai, Yu Nai-Biao, Huang Zhi-Yong, Li Long-Yun, Guo Yuan-Mei",BMC genomic data,2023,"Humans, Swine, Animals, Male, Female, Phenotype, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Genotype, Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length, Mutation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38036989/,"Jiangxi Shanxia Huaxi Pig Breeding Company Limited, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, 341000, China.; National Key Laboratory for Swine Genetic Improvement and Germplasm Innovation, Ministry of Science and Technology of China, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330045, China.; National Key Laboratory for Swine Genetic Improvement and Germplasm Innovation, Ministry of Science and Technology of China, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330045, China. gyuanmei@hotmail.com.; National Key Laboratory for Swine Genetic Improvement and Germplasm Innovation, Ministry of Science and Technology of China, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330045, China. lilongyun5816@outlook.com."
34924555,Genome-wide association study of pain sensitivity assessed by questionnaire and the cold pressor test.,"We deployed an online pain sensitivity questionnaire (PSQ) and an at-home version of the cold pressor test (CPT) in a large genotyped cohort. We performed genome-wide association studies on the PSQ score (25,321 participants) and CPT duration (6853). We identified one new genome-wide significant locus associated with the PSQ score, which was located in the TSSC1 (also known as EIPR1 ) gene (rs58194899, OR = 0.950 [0.933-0.967], P -value = 1.9 × 10 -8 ). Although high pain sensitivity measured by both PSQ and CPT was associated with individual history of chronic and acute pains, genetic correlation analyses surprisingly suggested an opposite direction: PSQ score was inversely genetically correlated with neck and shoulder pain ( rg = -0.71), rheumatoid arthritis (-0.68), and osteoarthritis (-0.38), and with known risk factors, such as the length of working week (-0.65), smoking (-0.36), or extreme BMI (-0.23). Gene-based analysis followed by pathway analysis showed that genome-wide association studies results were enriched for genes expressed in the brain and involved in neuronal development and glutamatergic synapse signaling pathways. Finally, we confirmed that females with red hair were more sensitive to pain and found that genetic variation in the MC1R gene was associated with an increase in self-perceived pain sensitivity as assessed by the PSQ.","Fontanillas Pierre, Kless Achim, Bothmer John, Tung Joyce Y, ",Pain,2022,"Female, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Pain, Pain Measurement, Pain Threshold, Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924555/,"23andMe, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, United States.; Grünenthal Innovation, Grünenthal GmbH, Aachen, Germany.

34573422,Genetic Variants and Somatic Alterations Associated with MITF-E318K Germline Mutation in Melanoma Patients.,"The MITF-E318K variant has been implicated in genetic predisposition to cutaneous melanoma. We addressed the occurrence of MITF-E318K and its association with germline status of CDKN2A and MC1R genes in a hospital-based series of 248 melanoma patients including cohorts of multiple, familial, pediatric, sporadic and melanoma associated with other tumors. Seven MITF-E318K carriers were identified, spanning every group except the pediatric patients. Three carriers showed mutated CDKN2A, five displayed MC1R variants, while the sporadic carrier revealed no variants. Germline/tumor whole exome sequencing for this carrier revealed germline variants of unknown significance in ATM and FANCI genes and, in four BRAF-V600E metastases, somatic loss of the MITF wild-type allele, amplification of MITF-E318K and deletion of a 9p21.3 chromosomal region including CDKN2A and MTAP. <i>In silico</i> analysis of tumors from MITF-E318K melanoma carriers in the TCGA Pan-Cancer-Atlas dataset confirmed the association with BRAF mutation and 9p21.3 deletion revealing a common genetic pattern. MTAP was the gene deleted at homozygous level in the highest number of patients.

31488411,<i>MC1R</i> Variation in a New Mexico Population.,"The Melanocortin 1 Receptor (<i>MC1R</i>) contributes to pigmentation, an important risk factor for developing melanoma. Evaluating SNPs in <i>MC1R</i> and association with race/ethnicity, skin type, and perceived cancer risk in a New Mexico (NM) population will elucidate the role of <i>MC1R</i> in a multicultural population. We genotyped <i>MC1R</i> in 191 NMs attending a primary care clinic in Albuquerque. We obtained individuals' self-identified race/ethnicity, skin type, and perceived cancer risk. We defined genetic risk as carriage of any one or more of the nine most common SNPs in <i>MC1R</i>. We found that one <i>MC1R</i> SNP, R163Q (rs885479), was identified in 47.6% of self-identified Hispanics and 12.9% of non-Hispanic whites (NHW), making Hispanics at higher ""genetic risk"" (as defined by carrying one of the <i>MC1R</i> common variants). When we deleted R163Q from analyses, Hispanics were no longer at higher genetic risk (33.3%) compared with NHW (48.3%), consistent with melanoma rates, tanning ability, and lower perceived risk. Hispanics had a perceived risk significantly lower than NHW and a nonsignificant better tanning ability than NHW. The R163Q variant in <i>MC1R</i> may not be a risk factor for melanoma among NM Hispanics. This suggestion points to the need to carefully interpret genetic risk factors among specific populations. Genetic risk cannot be extrapolated from Northern European populations directly to non-European populations.","White Kirsten A M, Dailey Yvonne T, Guest Dolores D, Zielaskowski Kate, Robers Erika, Sussman Andrew, Hunley Keith, Hughes Christopher R, Schwartz Matthew R, Kaphingst Kimberly A, Buller David B, Hay Jennifer L, Berwick Marianne","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2019,"Genetic Variation, Genotype, Humans, New Mexico, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31488411/,"Communication Department, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.; Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.; Department of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.; Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico. mberwick@salud.unm.edu.; Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.; Klein Buendel, Inc., Golden, Colorado."
35858770,Editing MC1R in human melanoma cells by CRISPR/Cas9 and functional analysis.,"MC1R (melanocortin 1 receptor) encodes the melanocortin-1 receptor, which can activate intracellular cAMP synthesis under the stimulation of the α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) ligand. Increased cAMP then activates the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, resulting in the up-regulation of the expression of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) which is a critical regulatory factor of melanin synthesis, and tyrosinase (TYR), the rate-limiting enzyme of melanin synthesis tyrosinase (TYR), and ultimately affects production of eumelanin and pheomelanin, and the coat color phenotype of mammalian species. Previous reports have indicated that the mutation A243T in the transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) of MC1R protein might disrupt the function of MC1R, contributing to the red phenotype in Duroc pig. However, functional analysis of the A243T mutation in MC1R has not yet been carried out. In this study, we attempted to used single-stranded oligo-deoxyribonucleotides (ssODN) as donor templates to introduce the c.727G>A (A243T) mutation into MC1R in human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-2 by CRISPR/Cas9 to analyze its effects on MC1R functions. We found the occurrence of ssODN recombination reached to 10%. Unfortunately, Sanger sequencing MC1R in six single-cell clones revealed that none carried the c.727G>A mutation, but all carried undesired mutations surrounding the target site. Cells transfected with CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids and ssODN presented significantly attenuated cAMP activation, and down-regulated MITF and TYR expression, indicating that the editing MC1R could affect the melanin synthesis function in cells.

22364200,Melanocortin-1 receptor-mediated signalling pathways activated by NDP-MSH and HBD3 ligands.,"Binding of melanocortin peptide agonists to the melanocortin-1 receptor of melanocytes results in eumelanin production, whereas binding of the agouti signalling protein inverse agonist results in pheomelanin synthesis. Recently, a novel melanocortin-1 receptor ligand was reported. A β-defensin gene mutation was found to be responsible for black coat colour in domestic dogs. Notably, the human equivalent, β-defensin 3, was found to bind with high affinity to the melanocortin-1 receptor; however, the action of β-defensin as an agonist or antagonist was unknown. Here, we use in vitro assays to show that β-defensin 3 is able to act as a weak partial agonist for cAMP signalling in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing human melanocortin-1 receptor. β-defensin 3 is also able to activate MAPK signalling in HEK cells stably expressing either wild type or variant melanocortin-1 receptors. We suggest that β-defensin 3 may be a novel melanocortin-1 receptor agonist involved in regulating melanocyte responses in humans.","Beaumont Kimberley A, Smit Darren J, Liu Yan Yan, Chai Eric, Patel Mira P, Millhauser Glenn L, Smith Jennifer J, Alewood Paul F, Sturm Richard A",Pigment cell & melanoma research,2012,"Agouti Signaling Protein, Anticarcinogenic Agents, Cyclic AMP, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Evaluation, Preclinical, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Ligands, MAP Kinase Signaling System, Melanocytes, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Signal Transduction, Up-Regulation, alpha-MSH, beta-Defensins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22364200/,"Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia."
31141850,Non-Invasive Buccal Swab Gene Testing for Skin Cancer Risk.,"Background: Studies have identified numerous genetic polymorphisms associated with increased risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). In this pilot study, we aimed to examine whether previously identified melanoma and non-melanoma associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which were found to be associated with cutaneous malignancy were also present in a relatively heterogeneous population with a history of skin cancer versus an age and environmental matched controls. The undertaking of this project serves to further the current understanding of the genetic profile for those at higher risk for developing skin cancer. Methods: Nineteen NMSC patients and their age-matched and environmental controls underwent genotyping of 7 previously discovered SNPs associated with melanoma and NMSC. Results: In a random, heterogeneous population in Southern California, SNP’s Chr1, PAD16, PIGU, TDG had a similar association with NMSC previously reported in prior studies. Due to small trial size, no conclusions or observable associations could be drawn from the SNPs MC1R, TP53, and XRCC1. Conclusion: This data supports that 4 of the 7 SNP’s studied had similar associations and could potentially be predictive tool of NMSC risk in this patient population. The remaining three SNP’s did not have a definitive association with malignancy. Larger studies are needed to further elucidate the specific roles of these SNPs collectively and ultimately to develop a genetic profile for those patients at increased risk of developing skin cancer.

32732695,The role of MC1R gene variants and phenotypical features in predicting high nevus count.,"Variants in the Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) gene have been associated with an increased risk of melanoma, but the role in nevus count is unclear. We investigated if specific MC1R gene variants or the number of MC1R gene variants and phenotypical features were associated with nevus count. A total of 494 participants of the 'Leiden skin cancer study' were included and the MC1R gene coding sequence was analysed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by sequencing of unknown variants. The association between MC1R gene variants and nevus count and the association between age, gender and phenotypical features and nevus count were studied using the Chi-square test. Study of nine frequently occurring MC1R gene variants in participants without skin cancer (n = 203) showed that the 'r' Val60Leu variant was significantly associated with high nevus count (>50 nevi) (P = 0.017). This association was very strong among women (P < 0.001), but not present among men. Having one or two MC1R variants in general did not show a significant difference in the nevus count. Hair colour, skin type, eye colour and age were not significantly associated with nevus count, whereas gender showed a significant association (P = 0.008), with the highest nevus counts in female.

35452484,Genetic diversity of the melanocortin-1 receptor in an admixed population of Rio de Janeiro: Structural and functional impacts of Cys35Tyr variant.,"The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is one of the key proteins involved in the regulation of melanin production and several polymorphisms have been associated with different phenotypes of skin and hair color in human and nonhuman species. Most of the knowledge is centered on more homogeneous populations and studies involving an admixed group of people should be encouraged due to the great importance of understanding the human color variation. This work evaluates the MC1R diversity and the possible impacts of MC1R variants in an admixed sample population of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which is a product of Native American, African, and European miscegenation. Sequencing of complete coding region and part of the 3´UTR of MC1R gene identified 31 variants including one insertion and three novel synonymous substitutions in sample population grouped according to skin, hair and eye pigmentation levels. In nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS), three main clusters were identified, in which the Brazilian dark skin group remained in the African cluster whereas the intermediate and the light skin color phenotype in the European one. None gathered with Asians since their immigration to Brazil was a recent event. In silico analyses demonstrated that Cys35Tyr, Ile155Thr and Pro256Ser, found in our population, have a negative effect on receptor function probably due to changes on the receptor structure. Notably, Cys35Tyr mutation could potentially impair agonist binding. Altogether, this work contributes to the understanding of the genetic background of color variation on an admixed population and gives insights into the damaging effects of MC1R variants.","Neitzke-Montinelli Vanessa, da Silva Figueiredo Celestino Gomes Priscila, Pascutti Pedro G, Moura-Neto Rodrigo S, Silva Rosane",PloS one,2022,"Brazil, Genetic Variation, Hair Color, Humans, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35452484/,"Instituto de Biofísica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."
20507942,Melanocortin 1 receptor agonists reduce proteinuria.,"Membranous nephropathy is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Recent reports suggest that treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) reduces proteinuria, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we identified gene expression of the melanocortin receptor MC1R in podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, and tubular epithelial cells. Podocytes expressed most MC1R protein, which colocalized with synaptopodin but not with an endothelial-specific lectin. We treated rats with passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) with MS05, a specific MC1R agonist, which significantly reduced proteinuria compared with untreated PHN rats (P < 0.01). Furthermore, treatment with MC1R agonists improved podocyte morphology and reduced oxidative stress. In summary, podocytes express MC1R, and MC1R agonism reduces proteinuria, improves glomerular morphology, and reduces oxidative stress in nephrotic rats with PHN. These data may explain the proteinuria-reducing effects of ACTH observed in patients with membranous nephropathy, and MC1R agonists may provide a new therapeutic option for these patients.","Lindskog Annika, Ebefors Kerstin, Johansson Martin E, Stefánsson Bergur, Granqvist Anna, Arnadottir Margret, Berg Anna-Lena, Nyström Jenny, Haraldsson Börje",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2010,"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, Adult, Aged, Animals, Disease Models, Animal, Endothelial Cells, Female, Glomerulonephritis, Membranous, Hormones, Humans, Male, Mesangial Cells, Middle Aged, Podocytes, Proteinuria, Rats, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Urothelium",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20507942/,"Department of Molecular and Clinical Nephrology, Institute of Medicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. annika.lindskog@wlab.gu.se"
23270471,Red hair benzothiazines and benzothiazoles: mutation-inspired chemistry in the quest for functionality.,"Nature provides a primary source of leads for the design of π-conjugated organic chromophores and other functional molecular systems useful for molecular recognition, light harvesting, photoconversion, and other technological applications. In this Account, we draw attention to a unique group of naturally occurring heterocyclic compounds, the 2H-1,4-benzothiazines and related benzothiazole derivatives. Derived from tyrosine and cysteine, these molecules arise from a mutation-induced deviation of the melanin pathway to provide the core structure of the red human hair pigments pheomelanins. Since the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of pheomelanins in the 1960s, researchers have focused on 1,4-benzothiazines and red hair pigments. Not only do these molecules have interesting photochemical and molecular recognition properties, they also have compelling biomedical significance. Numerous studies have linked higher levels of pheomelanins and mutations in the pathways that produce these pigments in individuals with red hair and fair skin with an increased sensitivity to UV light and a higher susceptibility to melanoma and other skin cancers. Prompted by new data about the structure and photochemistry of the bibenzothiazine system, this Account highlights the chemistry of benzothiazines in red-haired individuals as a novel source of inspiration in the quest for innovative scaffolds and biomimetic functional systems. Model studies have gradually shed light on a number of remarkable physical and chemical properties of benzothiazine-based systems. Bibenzothiazine is a robust visible chromophore that combines photochromism and acidichromism. Benzothiazine-based polymers (synthetic pheomelanins) show remarkable photochemical, paramagnetic, and redox cycling properties. Biomimetic or synthetic manipulations of the benzothiazine systems, through decarboxylation pathways controlled by metal ions or unusually facile ring-contraction processes, can produce a diverse set of molecular scaffolds.","Napolitano Alessandra, Panzella Lucia, Leone Loredana, d'Ischia Marco",Accounts of chemical research,2013,"Benzothiazoles, Hair, Hair Color, Humans, Mutation, Pigmentation, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Signal Transduction, Tyrosine",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23270471/,"Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cinthia 4, I-80126 Naples, Italy. alesnapo@unina.it"
36050717,"Dersimelagon, a novel oral melanocortin 1 receptor agonist, demonstrates disease-modifying effects in preclinical models of systemic sclerosis.","Activation of melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is known to exert broad anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of dersimelagon, a novel oral MC1R agonist, as a therapeutic agent for systemic sclerosis (SSc). The effects of dersimelagon phosphoric acid (MT-7117) on skin fibrosis and lung inflammation were evaluated in bleomycin (BLM)-induced SSc murine models that were optimized for prophylactic and therapeutic evaluation. Microarray-based gene expression analysis and serum protein profiling were performed in the BLM-induced SSc models. The effect of MT-7117 on transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced activation of human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated in vitro. Immunohistochemical analyses of MC1R expression in the skin of SSc patients were performed. Prophylactic treatment with MT-7117 (≥ 0.3 mg/kg/day p.o.) significantly inhibited skin fibrosis and lung inflammation, and therapeutic treatment with MT-7117 (≥ 3 mg/kg/day p.o.) significantly suppressed the development of skin fibrosis in the BLM-induced SSc models. Gene array analysis demonstrated that MT-7117 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via suppression of the activation of inflammatory cells and inflammation-related signals; additionally, vascular dysfunction was extracted as the pathology targeted by MT-7117. Serum protein profiling revealed that multiple SSc-related biomarkers including P-selectin, osteoprotegerin, cystatin C, growth and differentiation factor-15, and S100A9 were suppressed by MT-7117. MT-7117 inhibited the activation of human dermal fibroblasts by suppressing TGF-β-induced ACTA2 (encoding α-smooth muscle actin) mRNA elevation. MC1R was expressed by monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, blood vessels (endothelial cells), fibroblasts, and epidermis (keratinocytes) in the skin of SSc patients, suggesting that these MC1R-positive cells could be targets for MT-7117. MT-7117 demonstrates disease-modifying effects in preclinical models of SSc. Investigations of its mechanism of action and target expression analyses indicate that MT-7117 exerts its positive effect by affecting inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and fibrosis, which are all key pathologies of SSc. The results of the present study suggest that MT-7117 is a potential therapeutic agent for SSc.

19297406,Molecular genetics of human pigmentation diversity.,"The genetic basis underlying normal variation in the pigmentary traits of skin, hair and eye colour has been the subject of intense research directed at understanding the diversity seen both between and within human populations. A combination of approaches have been used including comparative genomics of candidate genes and the identification of regions of the human genome under positive selection, together with genome-wide and specific allele association studies. Independent selection for different pigmentation gene sets has been found between Asian, European and African populations. Several genome-wide association studies for pigmentation have now been conducted and identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in known, TYR, TYRP1, OCA2, SLC45A2, SLC24A5, MC1R, ASIP, KITLG and previously unknown SLC24A4, IRF4, TPCN2, candidate genes. The contribution of SNP polymorphisms present in populations from South Asia have been tested and alleles found at TYR, SLC45A2 and SLC24A5 can largely account for differences between those of darkest and lightest skin reflectance using a simple additive model. Skin and hair colour associations in Europeans are found within a range of pigmentation gene alleles, whereas blue-brown eye colour can be explained by a single SNP proposed to regulate OCA2 expression. Functional testing of variant alleles has begun to connect phenotype correlations with biological differences. Variant MC1R alleles show direct correlations between the biochemical signalling properties of the encoded receptor and the red-hair fair skin pigmentation phenotype. Direct testing of a range of clonal melanocyte cultures derived from donor skin tissue characterized for three causal SNPs within SLC45A2, SLC24A5 and OCA2 has assessed their impact on melanin content and tyrosinase enzyme activity. From a culmination of genetic and functional studies, it is apparent that a number of genes impacting melanosome biogenesis or the melanin biosynthetic pathway are candidates to explain the diversity seen in human pigmentation.",Sturm Richard A,Human molecular genetics,2009,"Animals, Eye Color, Genome-Wide Association Study, Hair Color, Humans, Melanins, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Skin Pigmentation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19297406/,"Melanogenix Group, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia. r.sturm@imb.uq.edu.au"

Upon activation by α-melanocyte stimulating hormone, MC1R triggers the cAMP cascade to stimulate eumelanogenesis. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify causative alleles in Pakistani families with skin and hair hypopigmentation. Six MC1R mutations segregated with the phenotype in seven families, including a p.Val174del in-frame deletion and a p.Tyr298* nonsense mutation, that were analyzed for function in heterologous HEK293 cells. p.Tyr298* MC1R showed no agonist-induced signaling to the cAMP or ERK pathways, nor detectable agonist binding. Conversely, signaling was comparable for p.Val174del and wild-type in HEK cells overexpressing the proteins, but binding analysis suggested impaired cell surface expression. Flow cytometry and confocal imaging studies revealed reduced plasma membrane expression of p.Val174del and p.Tyr298*.

37142186,Distinct cAMP Signaling Microdomains Differentially Regulate Melanosomal pH and Pigmentation.,"cAMP signaling is a well-established regulator of melanin synthesis. Two distinct cAMP signaling pathways-the transmembrane adenylyl cyclase pathway, activated primarily by the MC1R, and the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) pathway-affect melanin synthesis. The sAC pathway affects melanin synthesis by regulating melanosomal pH, and the MC1R pathway affects melanin synthesis by regulating gene expression and post-translational modifications. However, whether MC1R genotype affects melanosomal pH is poorly understood. We now report that loss of function MC1R does not affect melanosomal pH. Thus, sAC signaling appears to be the only cAMP signaling pathway that regulates melanosomal pH. We also addressed whether MC1R genotype affects sAC-dependent regulation of melanin synthesis. Although sAC loss of function in wild-type human melanocytes stimulates melanin synthesis, sAC loss of function has no effect on melanin synthesis in MC1R nonfunctional human and mouse melanocytes or skin and hair melanin in e/e mice. Interestingly, activation of transmembrane adenylyl cyclases, which increases epidermal eumelanin synthesis in e/e mice, leads to enhanced production of eumelanin in sAC-knockout mice relative to that in sAC wild-type mice. Thus, MC1R- and sAC-dependent cAMP signaling pathways define distinct mechanisms that regulate melanosomal pH and pigmentation.","Yusupova Maftuna, Zhou Dalee, You Jaewon, Gonzalez-Guzman Jeydi, Ghanta Megha B, Pu Hong, Abdel-Malek Zalfa, Chen Qiuying, Gross Steven S, D'Orazio John, Ito Shosuke, Wakamatsu Kazumasa, Harris Melissa L, Zippin Jonathan H",The Journal of investigative dermatology,2023,"Mice, Animals, Humans, Melanins, Adenylyl Cyclases, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Pigmentation, Melanocytes, Signal Transduction, Mice, Knockout, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37142186/,"Department of Biology, College of Arts and Sciences, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.; Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.; Department of Dermatology, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Dermatology, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA; Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA; Englander Institute of Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.

27488084,Melanocortin-1 Receptor Polymorphisms and the Risk of Complicated Sepsis After Trauma: A Candidate Gene Association Study.,"The aim of the study was to determine if melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with complicated sepsis after trauma. Nosocomial infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality after trauma. Several SNPs in inflammation-related genes have been associated with sepsis. MC1R is an anti-inflammatory mediator that may be involved in the immune response after trauma. We genotyped eight common MC1R SNPs in genomic DNA from subjects enrolled in a previously reported prospective cohort study. Subjects were adult trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit at a Level 1 trauma center (2003-2005). A total of 1,246 subjects were included in the analysis. The majority were male (70%), severely injured (81%), and injured by a blunt mechanism (89%). Forty percent developed sepsis, and 23% developed complicated sepsis, which was defined as sepsis with organ dysfunction. In logistic regression analysis, with adjustments for age, sex, body mass index, injury severity score, red blood cell transfusion requirement, and mechanism of injury, the MC1RR163Q variant (rs885479) was associated with a lower risk of developing complicated sepsis (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28-0.81, P = 0.006). In a subgroup of 511 subjects with genome-wide SNP data, the association between the MC1RR163Q variant and complicated sepsis remained significant after adjusting for genetic substructure (by principal components) and the above clinical factors (ORadj = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.13-0.70, P = 0.005). MC1RR163Q is associated with a lower risk of complicated sepsis after trauma.

12851336,"Significance of the melanocortin 1 receptor in regulating human melanocyte pigmentation, proliferation, and survival.","The characterization of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) expressed on human melanocytes and the findings that certain mutations in the POMC gene or the MC1R gene result in red hair phenotype underscore the significance of melanocortins and MC1R in regulating human pigmentation. We demonstrated that human melanocytes respond to alpha-melanocortin (alpha-MSH) or ACTH with increased proliferation and melanogenesis, and to agouti signaling protein by abrogation of these effects. alpha-MSH and ACTH were equipotent and more potent than beta-MSH, and gamma-MSH was the least potent in activating the MC1R and stimulating melanogenesis and proliferation of human melanocytes. We characterized the MC1R genotype in a panel of human melanocyte cultures and identified three cultures that were homozygous for Arg160Trp, heterozygous for Arg151Cys and Asp294His, and heterozygous for Arg160Trp and Asp294His substitutions, respectively. Those cultures failed to respond to alpha-MSH with increase in cAMP levels, tyrosinase activity, or proliferation and had an exaggerated response to the cytotoxic effect of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These loss-of-function mutations have been associated with red hair phenotype and increased risk for skin cancer. Melanocytes homozygous for Val29Met substitution in MC1R responded normally to alpha-MSH and UVB, suggesting that this variant is a polymorphism. We observed that alpha-MSH promotes human melanocyte survival by inhibiting the UV-induced apoptosis independently of melanin synthesis. This effect was absent in human melanocytes with loss of function MC1R mutations. We predict that the survival effect of alpha-MSH is caused by reduction of UV-induced DNA damage and contributes to the prevention of melanoma.","Kadekaro Ana Luisa, Kanto Hiromi, Kavanagh Renny, Abdel-Malek Zalfa A",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2003,"Agouti Signaling Protein, Animals, Cell Survival, Humans, Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, Melanocytes, Pigmentation, Proteins, Receptors, Corticotropin, Receptors, Melanocortin, Risk Factors, Skin Neoplasms, Ultraviolet Rays, alpha-MSH",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12851336/,"Department of Dermatology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267, USA."
23860522,Pigmentation-related phenotypes and risk of prostate cancer.,"Solar ultraviolet radiation exposure has been inversely related to prostate cancer incidence and mortality, possibly mediated through vitamin D status. Pigmentation-related traits influence endogenous vitamin D synthesis and may alter risk of prostate cancer. We examined prostate cancer in relation to hair and eye colour, and skin phototype in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort. Incident cancer was diagnosed in 1982 out of 20 863 men. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazards models. Prostate cancer risk did not differ by eye colour or skin phototype. Men with naturally red hair were significantly less likely to develop prostate cancer (HR=0.46, 95% CI 0.24-0.89) than men with light brown hair (reference). The red hair phenotype, which results from polymorphisms in the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene, is associated with lower risk of prostate cancer. This pigmentation-related trait may influence prostate cancer development either directly, through genetic effects or regulatory mechanisms related to MC1R, another nearby gene, or other pigmentation genes, or indirectly, through associations with other exposures such as sunlight or vitamin D status.","Weinstein S J, Virtamo J, Albanes D",British journal of cancer,2013,"Aged, Disease Susceptibility, Eye Color, Finland, Hair Color, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Phenotype, Proportional Hazards Models, Prostatic Neoplasms, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Registries, Skin Pigmentation, alpha-Tocopherol, beta Carotene",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23860522/,"Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. weinstes@mail.nih.gov"
31834199,Detangling red hair from pain: phenotype-specific contributions from different genetic variants in melanocortin-1 receptor.,"Genetic variation in melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) has a known role in red hair. Studies on responses to noxious stimuli in red-haired individuals have also been conducted, with mixed findings. To investigate a possible divergence between variants responsible for red hair and pain sensitivity, we performed a genewide association analysis in the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment cohort. All genotyped (17) MC1R variants were tested for association with heat pain temporal summation and sensitivity. Our analyses showed an association for pain sensitivity with the 5'-UTR, tagged by rs3212361, and 1 missense variant, rs885479 (R163Q), previously shown to be weakly associated with red hair. For both variants, the minor allele was protective. These results were validated in the 500,000-person UK Biobank cohort, where the minor alleles of rs3212361 and rs885479 were associated with a reduced count of persistent pain conditions as well as individual pain conditions. Haplotype association analysis revealed a possible joint effect from the 2 individual variants. The 5'-UTR variant rs3212361 was further identified as an expression quantitative trait locus, associated with reduced transcript levels of MC1R in the brain and in the peripheral tibial nerve. Hair colour association analysis of the loss-of-function 5'-UTR rs3212361 allele identified association with red hair, and red hair colour itself was associated with a reduced count of persistent pain conditions. Together, our results suggest that primarily different mechanisms-affecting expression levels vs protein activity-mediated by different genetic variants in the MC1R locus contribute to red hair and pain.","Zorina-Lichtenwalter Katerina, Maixner William, Diatchenko Luda",Pain,2020,"Adult, Alleles, Female, Genetic Variation, Hair Color, Humans, Male, Pain, Phenotype, Prospective Studies, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31834199/,"Alan Edwards Pain Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Department of Anesthesiology and Center of Translational Pain Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States."
33983985,Melanocytes determine angiogenesis gene expression across human tissues.,"Several angiogenesis-dependent diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and infantile hemangioma, display differential prevalence among Black, as compared to White individuals. Although socioeconomic status and genetic architecture have been suggested as explaining these differences, we have recently shown that pigment production per se might be involved. For example, we have shown that the extracellular protein fibromodulin is a pro-angiogenic factor highly secreted by melanocytes in White but not Black individuals. Still, additional pigment-dependent angiogenic factors and their molecular mechanisms remain to be identified. Understanding the contribution of pigmentation to angiogenesis in health and disease is essential for precision medicine of angiogenesis-dependent diseases with racial disparity. Toward that goal, we compared the transcriptomes of Black and White individuals in three tissues with angiogenic activity, namely artery, whole blood, and skin. We identified several differentially expressed angiogenesis pathways, including artery morphogenesis, regulation of endothelial cell chemotaxis, and cellular response to vascular endothelial growth factor stimulus. We then demonstrated that the expression of key genes in these pathways is directly modulated by the degree of pigmentation. We further identified the precise pigment production pathway controlling the expression of these genes, namely melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) signaling.

37319102,Polymorphisms in corticotrophin-releasing hormone-proopiomalanocortin (CRH-POMC) system genes: Neuroimmune contributions to psoriasis disease.,"Skin is a target organ and source of the corticotropin-releasing hormone-proopiomelanocortin (CRH-POMC) system, operating as a coordinator and executor of responses to stress. Environmental stress exacerbates and triggers inflammatory skin diseases through modifying the cellular components of the immune system supporting the importance of CRH-POMC system in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The aim of this study was to analyse the association of CRH-POMC polymorphisms with psoriasis and evaluate transcript expression of lesional psoriatic and normal skin in RNA-seq data. Samples of 104 patients with psoriasis and 174 healthy controls were genotyped for 42 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CRH-POMC using Applied Biosystems SNPlex™ method. The transcript quantification was performed using Salmon software v1.3.0. This study demonstrated the associations between melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) polymorphisms rs2228479, rs3212369, dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) polymorphisms rs7987802, rs2031526, rs9524501 and psoriasis in the Tatar population. Very strong association was evident for the SNP rs7987802 in the DCT gene (p<sub>c</sub>  = 5.95е-006) in psoriasis patients. Additionally, the haplotype analysis provided AT DCT (rs7992630 and rs7987802) and AGA MC1R (rs3212358, 2228479 and 885479) haplotypes significantly associated (p<sub>c</sub>  ˂ 0.05) with psoriasis in the Tatar population, supporting the involvement of DCT and MC1R to the psoriasis susceptibility.

17523926,Genetic factors associated with skin cancer in renal transplant patients.,"Non-melanoma skin cancer represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among renal transplant recipients. Established risk factors that increase susceptibility to skin cancer after transplantation include skin type, sun exposure and level of immunosuppression. A comprehensive literature review was carried out to discuss relevant genetic polymorphism for the development of skin cancer in organ transplant recipients. These include genetic polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferase, interleukin-10, retinoblastoma and p53 genes. We also discuss genetic polymorphisms in the folate pathway, melanocortin 1 receptor and vitamin D receptor recently discovered in our group. No single factor is causative in cutaneous carcinogenesis in transplant recipients. Interactions of some of the above mechanisms with known environmental factors lead to increased risk. Polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase are potentially correctable with folic acid supplementation; however, further evaluation is required in adequately powered prospective clinical trials. Avoidance of known oncogenic environmental factors and genetic risk evaluation may improve outcomes in transplant patients.","Laing Mary Elizabeth, Kay Elaine, Conlon Peter, Murphy Gillian M","Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine",2007,"Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Kidney Transplantation, Polymorphism, Genetic, Risk Factors, Skin Neoplasms",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17523926/,"Department of Dermatology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. mrylaing@yahoo.co.uk"
14704187,Sequences associated with human iris pigmentation.,"To determine whether and how common polymorphisms are associated with natural distributions of iris colors, we surveyed 851 individuals of mainly European descent at 335 SNP loci in 13 pigmentation genes and 419 other SNPs distributed throughout the genome and known or thought to be informative for certain elements of population structure. We identified numerous SNPs, haplotypes, and diplotypes (diploid pairs of haplotypes) within the OCA2, MYO5A, TYRP1, AIM, DCT, and TYR genes and the CYP1A2-15q22-ter, CYP1B1-2p21, CYP2C8-10q23, CYP2C9-10q24, and MAOA-Xp11.4 regions as significantly associated with iris colors. Half of the associated SNPs were located on chromosome 15, which corresponds with results that others have previously obtained from linkage analysis. We identified 5 additional genes (ASIP, MC1R, POMC, and SILV) and one additional region (GSTT2-22q11.23) with haplotype and/or diplotypes, but not individual SNP alleles associated with iris colors. For most of the genes, multilocus gene-wise genotype sequences were more strongly associated with iris colors than were haplotypes or SNP alleles. Diplotypes for these genes explain 15% of iris color variation. Apart from representing the first comprehensive candidate gene study for variable iris pigmentation and constituting a first step toward developing a classification model for the inference of iris color from DNA, our results suggest that cryptic population structure might serve as a leverage tool for complex trait gene mapping if genomes are screened with the appropriate ancestry informative markers.","Frudakis Tony, Thomas Matthew, Gaskin Zach, Venkateswarlu K, Chandra K Suresh, Ginjupalli Siva, Gunturi Sitaram, Natrajan Sivamani, Ponnuswamy Viswanathan K, Ponnuswamy K N",Genetics,2003,"Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22, Europe, Eye Color, Genetic Variation, Genome, Human, Genotype, Haplotypes, Humans, Iris, Pigmentation, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14704187/,"DNAPrint Genomics, Sarasota, Florida 34236, USA. tfrudakis@dnaprint.com"
26437741,Assessment of gene expression levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) in vitiligo.,"Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) are regulators of melanogenesis and pigmentation. Our objective was to estimate their levels, searching for a possible role of the melanocortin system in vitiligo. This study included 40 vitiligo patients and 40 controls. Skin biopsies were taken from lesional and non-lesional skin of patients and from the non-sun exposed skin of controls to detect the expression of POMC and MC1R using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Both factors were significantly lower in lesional than non-lesional skin and controls, while they were significantly higher in non-lesional skin than in controls. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between lesional levels of POMC and MC1R, as well as between non-lesional levels of POMC and MC1R in the patients. On the other hand, we found a statistically significant negative correlation between the lesional and non-lesional levels of POMC, as well as between the lesional and non-lesional levels of MC1R in the patients. As a conclusion, the melanocortin system could play a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo or could be affected as the end result of the disease.","Nagui Noha A, Mahmoud Sara B, Abdel Hay Rania M, Hassieb May M, Rashed Laila A",The Australasian journal of dermatology,2017,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Case-Control Studies, Child, Female, Gene Expression, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pro-Opiomelanocortin, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin, Vitiligo, Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26437741/,"Clinical Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.; Dermatology Department, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."
27755135,Genetic analysis of melanocortin 1 receptor red hair color variants in a Russian population of Eastern Siberia.,"The melanocortin 1 receptor is a Gs protein-coupled receptor implicated in melanogenesis regulation. The receptor gene is highly polymorphic, which accounts for the association of several of its single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an increased risk of melanoma. The present study aimed to evaluate the distribution of melanocortin 1 receptor gene variants R151C, R160W, and D294H within the Russian population of Eastern Siberia and its association with melanoma development. Melanoma patients (n=95) admitted to Krasnoyarsk Territorial Oncological Center and healthy controls (n=334) were enrolled in the study. A clinical examination of patients was performed to evaluate the phenotypic features of melanoma patients. SNPs were analyzed by real-time PCR. Clinical examination indicated a more frequent occurrence of fair skin type, blue eyes, blonde and red hair, and more frequent localization of freckles on the neck, trunk, and extremities in the melanoma group of patients. The R151C melanocortin 1 receptor gene variant was found in 18% of melanoma patients and associated with an increased likelihood of melanoma development (odds ratio=6.4; 95% confidence interval: 2.8-14.3; P=0.0001). The two remaining variant alleles of the melanocortin 1 receptor gene occurred with low frequency both in controls and in the melanoma group. The R160W SNP was identified neither in controls nor in melanoma patients. The D294H heterozygous variant was observed in 0.3% of individuals in the control group and in 1.1% of the patients in the melanoma group. Such an asymmetric distribution of the melanocortin 1 receptor within red hair color genotypes in the population under study compared with other populations may be because of Russian genetic homogeneity. Carriers of the mutant R151C allele should exercise caution in terms of exposure to the sun to avoid the risk of melanoma development.","Motorina Anna V, Palkina Nadezhda V, Komina Anna V, Ruksha Tatiana G, Artyukhov Ivan P, Kozlov Vasily V",European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),2018,"Case-Control Studies, Gene Frequency, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Hair Color, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Melanoma, Odds Ratio, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Siberia, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27755135/,"Department of Public Health and Health Care Organization, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation.; Departments of Pathophysiology.; Management in Public Health, Krasnoyarsk State Medical University, Krasnoyarsk."
11487574,The melanocortin-1-receptor gene is the major freckle gene.,"Ephelides and solar lentigines are different types of pigmented skin lesions. Ephelides appear early in childhood and are associated with fair skin type and red hair. Solar lentigines appear with increasing age and are a sign of photodamage. Both lesions are strong risk indicators for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene variants are also associated with fair skin, red hair and melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between MC1R gene variants, ephelides and solar lentigines. In a large case-control study, patients with melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer and subjects without a history of skin cancer were studied. In all participants, the presence of ephelides in childhood and solar lentigines by physical examination was assessed according to strict definitions. The entire coding sequence of the MC1R gene was analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by sequence analyses. Carriers of one or two MC1R gene variants had a 3- and 11-fold increased risk of developing ephelides, respectively (both P < 0.0001), whereas the risk of developing severe solar lentigines was increased 1.5- and 2-fold (P = 0.035 and P < 0.0001), respectively. These associations were independent of skin type and hair color, and were comparable in patients with and without a history of skin cancer. The population attributable risk for ephelides to MC1R gene variants was 60%, i.e. 60% of the ephelides in the population was caused by MC1R gene variants. A dosage effect was found between the degree of ephelides and the number of MC1R gene variants. As nearly all individuals with ephelides were carriers of at least one MC1R gene variant, our data suggest that MC1R gene variants are necessary to develop ephelides. The results of the study also suggest that MC1R gene variants play a role, although less important, in the development of solar lentigines.","Bastiaens M, ter Huurne J, Gruis N, Bergman W, Westendorp R, Vermeer B J, Bouwes Bavinck J N",Human molecular genetics,2001,"Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Case-Control Studies, Child, Data Interpretation, Statistical, Female, Gene Dosage, Genetic Variation, Hair Color, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Melanosis, Middle Aged, Receptors, Corticotropin, Receptors, Melanocortin, Risk Factors, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Physiological Phenomena, Sunburn, Sunlight",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11487574/,"Department of Dermatology and Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Centre, PO Box 9600, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands."
28947386,Human melanocortin 1 receptor-mediated ubiquitination of nonvisual arrestins. Role of Mahogunin Ring Finger 1 E3 ligase.,"Signaling from the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crucial for melanocyte proliferation and differentiation, is regulated by cytosolic β-arrestins (ARRBs). MC1R signaling is also negatively modulated by the E3-ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1), whose mutation causes hyperpigmentation, congenital heart defects and neurodegeneration in mice. We showed previously that although MC1R interacts stably with human ARRB1 or ARRB2, only ARRB2 mediates receptor desensitization and internalization. We analyzed MC1R-dependent ARRB ubiquitination, and the possible role of MGRN1. ARRB1 expressed in heterologous cells or human melanoma cells migrated in SDS-PAGE as a 55kDa protein whereas ARRB2 migrated as two major bands of apparent molecular weight near 45 and 55kDa, with an intermediate mobility band occasionally detected. These forms were related by post-translational modification rather than by proteolysis. Presence of MC1R favored expression of the 45kDa protein, the form that interacted preferentially with MC1R. MC1R also mediated poly- or multimonoubiquitination of ARRB2. Ubiquitination was agonist-independent, but required a native MC1R conformation and/or normal receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane, as it was not observed for loss-of-function MC1R variants. In a heterologous expression system, MC1R-dependent ARRB ubiquitination was enhanced by overexpression of MGRN1 and was impaired by siRNA-mediated MGRN1 knockdown thus pointing to MGRN1 as the responsible E3-ligase. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated interaction of MGRN1 and ARRBs in the presence of MC1R, suggesting a scaffolding role for the GPCR that may determine the selectivity of E3-ubiquitin ligase engagement and the functional outcome of ARRB ubiquitination.","Abrisqueta Marta, Olivares Concepción, Herraiz Cecilia, Castejón-Griñán María, Sirés-Campos Julia, García-Borrón José C, Jiménez-Cervantes Celia",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

We studied Hispanic subjects, predominately of Puerto Rican heritage, from Tampa, Florida, US, and Ponce, PR. Blood or saliva samples were collected by prospective recruitment or retrieved from biobanks for genotyping of MC1R variants and ancestry informative markers. Participant demographic and self-reported phenotypic information was collected via biobank records or questionnaires. We determined associations of MC1R genetic risk categories and phenotypic variables and genetic ancestry. Over half of participants carried MC1R variants known to increase risk of skin cancer, and there was diversity in the observed variants across sample populations. Associations between MC1R genetic risk groups and some pigmentation characteristics were identified. Among Puerto Ricans, the proportion of participants carrying MC1R variants imparting elevated skin cancer risk was consistent across quartiles of European, African, and Native American genetic ancestry. These findings demonstrate that MC1R variants are important for pigmentation characteristics in Hispanics and that carriage of high risk MC1R alleles occurs even among Hispanics with stronger African or Native American genetic ancestry.","Smit Amelia K, Collazo-Roman Marielys, Vadaparampil Susan T, Valavanis Stella, Del Rio Jocelyn, Soto Brenda, Flores Idhaliz, Dutil Julie, Kanetsky Peter A",Scientific reports,2020,"Alleles, Female, Hispanic or Latino, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Polymorphism, Genetic, Prospective Studies, Puerto Rico, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32350296/,"Cancer Biology Division, Ponce Research Institute, Ponce Health Science University, Ponce, Puerto Rico.; Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Sydney School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.; Department of Cancer Epidemiology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.; Department of Cancer Epidemiology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA. peter.kanetsky@moffitt.org.; Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.; Public Health Program, Ponce Health Science University, Ponce, Puerto Rico.; School of Medicine, Ponce Health Science University, Ponce, Puerto Rico."
21907230,Childhood exposure to ultraviolet radiation and harmful skin effects: epidemiological evidence.,"We review the general amount and patterns of exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation that children and teenagers experience and the spectrum of UV-related skin damage that can occur as a result. Data about the amount of solar UV received by children and teenagers are relatively few but suggest that around 40-50% of total UV to age 60 occurs before age 20. Among white children, those with the palest complexions suffer the most damage. Comparisons of prevalence and incidence of outcomes in children and teenagers sharing common ancestry, but living at different latitudes, show that prevalence rates of photoaging and melanocytic naevi are higher in Australian compared with British children, and similarly for melanoma. Genetic risk for the majority of the melanomas in teens is a function of genes controlling naevus propensity and pigmentation in the skin. High numbers of naevi and freckles, red hair, blue eyes, inability to tan, as well as a family history are the primary determinants of melanoma among adolescents. Beyond the signs of skin damage seen in children are the latent effects observed later in adulthood. Childhood is believed to be a susceptible window for long-term harmful effects of UV, as evidenced by clear differences in skin cancer risk between child and adult migrants from high to low latitudes. Effective UV radiation protection from childhood is necessary to control both immediate and long-term harmful effects on children's skin.","Green Adèle C, Wallingford Sarah C, McBride Penelope",Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,2011,"Child, Environmental Exposure, Humans, Radiation Injuries, Skin, Skin Neoplasms, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21907230/,"Cancer and Population Studies Group, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

20189796,MC1R variants increase melanoma risk in families with CDKN2A mutations: a meta-analysis.,"We performed a meta-analysis to assess whether MC1R variants increase the risk of melanoma in CDKN2A mutation carriers of melanoma-prone families. Data from 96 CDKN2A-positive melanoma-prone families from seven independent populations of Europe, United States and Australia were included in the analysis. Summary risk estimates were calculated by random-effect models. We explored between-study heterogeneity and publication bias. Association between MC1R variants and age at diagnosis was assessed by the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. CDKN2A mutation carriers with 1 MC1R variant showed a double melanoma risk as compared to CDKN2A mutation carriers without MC1R variants (Summary OR; 95%CI: 2.2; 1.1-4.5). MC1R heterozygous subjects had no significantly higher melanoma risk than wild-type subjects (1.6; 0.5-5.4) while carriers of multiple MC1R variants had a more than four-times higher melanoma risk (4.6; 1.3-16.4). Carriers of red hair colour (RHC) variants showed an increased melanoma risk with a Summary OR of 3.5 (95%CI: 1.3-9.9). CDKN2A mutation carriers with MC1R variants had a statistically significant lower median age at melanoma diagnosis than CDKN2A mutation carriers with no MC1R variants (37years versus 47years, p-value<0.0001). MC1R variants significantly increase penetrance of CDKN2A mutations in melanoma-prone families, especially with respect to multiple MC1R variants and to RHC variants. A significant anticipation of melanoma diagnosis is observed in CDKN2A mutation carriers with MC1R variants.","Fargnoli Maria Concetta, Gandini Sara, Peris Ketty, Maisonneuve Patrick, Raimondi Sara","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2010,"Australia, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16, Europe, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Variation, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Mutation, Odds Ratio, Pedigree, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Skin Neoplasms, United States",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20189796/,"Department of Dermatology, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy."
28579117,Key amino acid residue in Melanocortin-1 receptor (melanocyte α-MSH receptor) for ligand selectivity.,"The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is a subtype of the melanocortin receptor family and NDP-α-MSH is a non-selective agonist for MC1R. The core sequence of NDP-α-MSH, His-Phe-Arg-Trp, is important for ligand binding and biological activities at the melanocortin receptor subtypes (MCRs). A recent study indicates that Trp<sup>9</sup> in NDP-α-MSH plays an important role in ligand selectivity. Deletion of Trp<sup>9</sup> in NDP-α-MSH (des-Trp<sup>9</sup>-NDP-α-MSH) resulted in loss of agonist activity at MC4R, although remains agonist activity at MC1R. The molecular basis for this receptor ligand selectivity is unknown. In this study we examined what region of the MC1R is responsible for des-NDP-α-MSH selectivity. Our results indicate that (1) substitution of TM3 of MC4R with the corresponding region of MC1R switches des-Trp<sup>9</sup>-NDP-α-MSH from no activity to agonist; (2) des-Trp<sup>9</sup>-NDP-α-MSH exhibits agonistic activity at the L133M mutation of the MC4R; and (3) substitution of non-conserved amino acid residue M128 in TM3 of MC1R significantly reduced des-Trp<sup>9</sup>-NDP-α-MSH agonist activity. Our results demonstrate that amino acid residue 128 in TM3 of MC1R, or amino acid residue L133 in TM3 of the MC4R, play crucial roles in ligand des-Trp<sup>9</sup>-NDP-α-MSH selectivity at MC1R or MC4R.","Yang Yingkui, Chen Min, Ventro George, Harmon Carroll M",Molecular and cellular endocrinology,2017,"Amino Acid Sequence, Amino Acids, Conserved Sequence, Cyclic AMP, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Ligands, Mutation, Protein Domains, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4, Structure-Activity Relationship, alpha-MSH",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28579117/,"Department of Surgery, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14203, United States.; Department of Surgery, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14203, United States.

19194882,Genetic determinants of hair color and Parkinson's disease risk.,"A history of melanoma is associated with increased risks for Parkinson's disease (PD). We examined whether hair color, one of the most important phenotypes of pigmentation and a risk factor for melanoma, was associated with PD risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; 1986-2002) and the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1980-2002). We included 38,641 men and 93,661 women who were free of PD at baseline. Information on natural hair color in early adulthood (age 18-21 years) was assessed via a questionnaire. We also conducted a case-control study (298 PD cases) nested in these two cohorts to examine the association between the melanocortin1-receptor Arg151Cys polymorphism and PD risk. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models in the cohort analyses and conditional logistic regression in the nested case-control study. PD risk increased with decreasing darkness of hair color. Pooled RRs for PD were 1 (reference), 1.40, 1.61, and 1.93 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.4) for black, brown, blond, and red hair, respectively, after adjusting for age, smoking, ethnicity, and other covariates. The associations between hair color and PD were particularly strong for relative younger onset of PD (<70 yr) (adjusted RR for red vs black hair = 3.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-8.7). In the case-control study, participants with Cys/Cys genotype, which was associated with red hair, had a greater PD risk, relative to the Arg/Arg genotype (adjusted RR, 3.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.4).

20381640,Signaling pathways in melanosome biogenesis and pathology.,"Melanosomes are the specialized intracellular organelles of pigment cells devoted to the synthesis, storage and transport of melanin pigments, which are responsible for most visible pigmentation in mammals and other vertebrates. As a direct consequence, any genetic mutation resulting in alteration of melanosomal function, either because affecting pigment cell survival, migration and differentiation, or because interfering with melanosome biogenesis, transport and transfer to keratinocytes, is immediately translated into color variations of skin, fur, hair or eyes. Thus, over 100 genes and proteins have been identified as pigmentary determinants in mammals, providing us with a deep understanding of this biological system, which functions by using mechanisms and processes that have parallels in other tissues and organs. In particular, many genes implicated in melanosome biogenesis have been characterized, so that melanosomes represent an incredible source of information and a model for organelles belonging to the secretory pathway. Furthermore, the function of melanosomes can be associated with common physiological phenotypes, such as variation of pigmentation among individuals, and with rare pathological conditions, such as albinism, characterized by severe visual defects. Among the most relevant mechanisms operating in melanosome biogenesis are the signal transduction pathways mediated by two peculiar G protein-coupled receptors: the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), involved in the fair skin/red hair phenotype and skin cancer; and OA1 (GPR143), whose loss-of-function results in X-linked ocular albinism.

Interventions in college settings have relied on appearance-focused appeals and have not been able to examine the cumulative effect of multiple behavior change and skin cancer risk communication strategies. The goal of the current study was to examine the unique and combined impacts of personalized ultraviolet (UV) radiation photographs, genetic testing for skin cancer risk, and general skin cancer prevention education. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) skin cancer prevention education, (2) education + UV photo, (3) education + genetic testing, and (4) education + UV photo + genetic testing. Self-reported sun protection, tanning, and sunburn were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 1 month post-intervention. The findings indicated benefits of the interventions to skin cancer prevention behaviors in the overall sample; however, the combined (UV photo + genetic testing) intervention had the most consistent positive effects on behaviors. Intervention effects were distinct across seasons. These results suggest that interventions containing multiple skin cancer risk communication strategies hold promise in benefitting health-promoting behavior changes in an at-risk, young adult population.Trial Registration Number: NCT03979872; Registered 6/5/2019.","Wu Yelena P, Hamilton Jada G, Kaphingst Kimberly A, Jensen Jakob D, Kohlmann Wendy, Parsons Bridget G, Lillie Helen M, Wang Xuechen, Haaland Benjamin, Wankier Ali P, Grossman Douglas, Hay Jennifer L",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2023,"Humans, Young Adult, Sunburn, Ultraviolet Rays, Health Education, Health Behavior, Skin Neoplasms, Photography, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36306029/,"Department of Communication, University of Utah, 255 Central Campus Drive, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.; Department of Dermatology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, 30 North 1900 East, 4A330-Salt Lake City, UT, 84132, USA.; Department of Dermatology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, 30 North 1900 East, 4A330-Salt Lake City, UT, 84132, USA. yelena.wu@utah.edu.; Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY, 10065, USA.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, 2000 Circle of Hope Drive, Rm LL376, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA."
21052032,Sequence polymorphisms of MC1R gene and their association with depression and antidepressant response.,"Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is involved in various functions, such as pigmentation, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory actions, development of melanoma, susceptibility to ultraviolet-induced sun damage, modification of oculocutaneous albinism, development of freckles, and mediation of female-specific mechanisms of analgesia. MC1R's natural agonists include α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and corticotrophin (ACTH1-39), which are important components of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and increase in response to stress. Given the multiple relevant roles of MC1R, we studied whether the MC1R gene would be associated with susceptibility to major depressive disorder or with response to antidepressant treatment. The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic; therefore, we sequenced the entire MC1R coding region of 1122 bp in 181 depressed Mexican-American patients and 185 Mexican-American controls. A total of 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, 15 known and eight new) were found within the sequenced region. Among the common SNPs, the nonsynonymous SNP, rs885479 (R163Q) was associated with the diagnosis of depression (P=0.04). The nonsynonymous SNP, rs2228479 (V92M) and the synonymous SNP, rs2228478 were found to be associated with the remission with desipramine treatment. No associations were found for remission with fluoxetine treatment or for the combined sample treated with fluoxetine or desipramine.

26030184,Race and Melanocortin 1 Receptor Polymorphism R163Q Are Associated with Post-Burn Hypertrophic Scarring: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"The genetic determinants of post-burn hypertrophic scarring (HTS) are unknown, and melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) loss-of-function leads to fibrogenesis in experimental models. To examine the associations between self-identified race and MC1R single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with severity of post-burn HTS, we conducted a prospective cohort study of burned adults admitted to our institution over 7 years. Subjects were evaluated using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), asked to rate their itching, and genotyped for 8 MC1R SNPs. Testing for association with severe HTS (VSS>7) and itch severity (0-10) was based on multivariate regression with adjustment for known risk factors. Of 425 subjects analyzed, 77% identified as White. The prevalence of severe HTS (VSS>7) was 49%, and the mean itch score was 3.9. In multivariate analysis, Asian (prevalence ratio (PR) 1.54; 95% CI: 1.13-2.10), Black/African American (PR 1.86; 95% CI: 1.42-2.45), and Native American (PR 1.87; 95% CI: 1.48-2.35) race were independently associated with severe HTS. MC1R SNP R163Q was also significantly (P<0.001) associated with severe HTS. Asian race (linear regression coefficient 1.32; 95% CI: 0.23-2.40) but not MC1R SNP genotype was associated with increased itch score. We conclude that MC1R genotype may influence post-burn scarring.","Sood Ravi F, Hocking Anne M, Muffley Lara A, Ga Maricar, Honari Shari, Reiner Alexander P, Rowhani-Rahbar Ali, Gibran Nicole S",The Journal of investigative dermatology,2015,"Adult, Burns, Cicatrix, Hypertrophic, Cohort Studies, Female, Genotype, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Poisson Distribution, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Prevalence, Prospective Studies, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Risk Assessment, Severity of Illness Index, Wound Healing",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26030184/,"Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA; Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Surgery, UW Medicine Regional Burn Center, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Surgery, UW Medicine Regional Burn Center, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.

36536132,Aberrant expression of agouti signaling protein (ASIP) as a cause of monogenic severe childhood obesity.,"Here we report a heterozygous tandem duplication at the ASIP (agouti signaling protein) gene locus causing ubiquitous, ectopic ASIP expression in a female patient with extreme childhood obesity. The mutation places ASIP under control of the ubiquitously active itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase promoter, driving the generation of ASIP in patient-derived native and induced pluripotent stem cells for all germ layers and hypothalamic-like neurons. The patient's phenotype of early-onset obesity, overgrowth, red hair and hyperinsulinemia is concordant with that of mutant mice ubiquitously expressing the homolog nonagouti. ASIP represses melanocyte-stimulating hormone-mediated activation as a melanocortin receptor antagonist, which might affect eating behavior, energy expenditure, adipocyte differentiation and pigmentation, as observed in the index patient. As the type of mutation escapes standard genetic screening algorithms, we rescreened the Leipzig Childhood Obesity cohort of 1,745 patients and identified four additional patients with the identical mutation, ectopic ASIP expression and a similar phenotype. Taken together, our data indicate that ubiquitous ectopic ASIP expression is likely a monogenic cause of human obesity.","Kempf Elena, Landgraf Kathrin, Stein Robert, Hanschkow Martha, Hilbert Anja, Abou Jamra Rami, Boczki Paula, Herberth Gunda, Kühnapfel Andreas, Tseng Yu-Hua, Stäubert Claudia, Schöneberg Torsten, Kühnen Peter, Rayner N William, Zeggini Eleftheria, Kiess Wieland, Blüher Matthias, Körner Antje",Nature metabolism,2022,"Child, Humans, Female, Animals, Mice, Agouti Signaling Protein, Pediatric Obesity, Pigmentation, Mutation, Phenotype",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36536132/,"Department of Environmental Immunology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Leipzig, Germany.; Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.; Division of Molecular Biochemistry, Rudolf Schönheimer Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.; Helmholtz Institute for Metabolic Obesity and Vascular Research (HI-MAG) of the Helmholtz Zentrum München at the University of Leipzig and University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.; Institute for Experimental Pediatric Endocrinology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.; Institute of Translational Genomics, Helmholtz Zentrum München - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.; Section on Integrative Physiology and Metabolism, Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Center for Pediatric Research, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.; University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Center for Pediatric Research, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany. antje.koerner@medizin.uni-leipzig.de.; University Medical Center Leipzig, Institute of Human Genetics, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany."

39633478,The melanocortin receptor genes are linked to and associated with the risk of polycystic ovary syndrome in Italian families.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder occurring in women of reproductive age. The disease is caused by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors including genes encoding components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We have recently reported the association of melanocortin receptor genes (MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R) with the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and/or major depressive disorder (MDD). The latter 2 disorders are comorbid with PCOS. In this study, we used microarray to test 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MC1R gene, 10 SNPs in the MC2R gene, 5 SNPs in the MC3R gene, 6 SNPs in the MC4R gene, and 4 SNPs in the MC5R gene in 212 original Italian families with PCOS. We identified 1 SNP in MC1R, 1 SNP in MC2R, 2 SNPs in MC3R, and 2 SNPs in MC5R significantly linked and/or associated to/with the risk of PCOS in Italian families. This is the first study to report the novel implication of melanocortin receptor genes (MC1R, MC2R, and MC5R) in PCOS. MC3R and MC4R were previously reported in PCOS.

20601102,Genetics of pigmentation in skin cancer--a review.,"Skin pigmentation is one of the most overt human physical traits with consequences on susceptibility to skin cancer. The variations in skin pigmentation are dependent on geographic location and population ethnicity. Skin colouration is mainly due to the pigmentation substance melanin, produced in specialized organelles (melanosomes) within dendritic melanocytes, and transferred to neighbouring keratinocytes. The two types of melanin synthesized in well defined chemical reactions are the protective dark coloured eumelanin and the sulphur containing light red-yellow pheomelanin. The events leading to the synthesis of melanin are controlled by signalling cascades that involve a host of genes encoding ligands, receptors, transcription factors, channel transporters and many other crucial molecules. Several variants within the genes involved in pigmentation have been associated with high risk phenotypes like fair skin, brown-red hair and green-blue eyes. Many of those variants have also been implicated in the risk of various skin cancers. The variants within the key pigmentation gene, melanocortin-receptor 1 (MC1R), in particular have been ubiquitously linked with high risk traits and skin cancers involving both pigmentary and non-pigmentary functions and likely interaction with variants in other genes. Many of the variants in other genes, functional in pigmentation pathway, have also been associated with phenotypic variation and risk of skin cancers. Those genes include agouti signalling protein (ASIP), tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2), various solute carrier genes and transporters. Most of those associations have been confirmed in genome wide association studies that at the same time have also identified new loci involved in phenotypic variation and skin cancer risk. In conclusion, the genetic variants within the genes involved in skin pigmentation besides influencing phenotypic traits are important determinants of risk of several skin cancers. However, ultimate risk of skin cancer is dependent on interplay between genetic and host factors.","Scherer Dominique, Kumar Rajiv",Mutation research,2010,"Carcinoma, Basal Cell, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Risk, Signal Transduction, Skin Neoplasms, Skin Pigmentation, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20601102/,"Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.; Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.

We found evidence of an association between the degree of tanning after repeated sun exposure, and the number of variant alleles present. Heterozygotes were intermediate between wild-type individuals and those with two variant alleles.

35775692,A Founder Mutation in the POMC 5'-UTR Causes Proopiomelanocortin Deficiency Through Splicing-Mediated Decrease of mRNA.,"The syndrome of adrenal insufficiency, obesity, and red hair is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The majority of disease-causing variants associated with the syndrome are located in the coding region of the POMC gene. This work describes 7 unrelated patients who shared a novel homozygous mutation in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the POMC gene and functionally characterize this novel variant. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) with autozygosity mapping, Sanger sequencing, model expression system studies, and RNA sequencing were used for identification of the disease-causing variant and its subsequent functional characterization. Seven unrelated patients of the Perm Tatar ethnic group presented with hypoglycemia and excessive weight gain, low plasma adrenocorticotropin, and cortisol. Five of 7 children had red hair; 6 of 7 patients also showed signs of bronchial obstruction. WES showed shared autozygosity regions overlapping the POMC gene. Sanger sequencing of the POMC 5'-UTR detected a homozygous variant chr2:25391366C > T (hg19) at the splice donor site of intron 1. As demonstrated by the model expression system, the variant led to a significant decrease in the POMC messenger RNA level. Analyses of the patients' haplotypes were suggestive of the founder effect. We estimate that the mutation must have occurred at least 4.27 generations ago (95% CI, 0.86-7.67). This report presents a new molecular mechanism of POMC deficiency and contributes to the information on phenotypic variability in patients with this disorder.","Viakhireva Iuliia, Kalinchenko Natalia, Vasilyev Evgeny, Chistousova Galina V, Filatova Alexandra, Marakhonov Andrey, Rubtsov Petr M, Skoblov Mikhail, Tiulpakov Anatoly",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2022,"5' Untranslated Regions, Adrenal Insufficiency, Child, Founder Effect, Humans, Mutation, Obesity, Pro-Opiomelanocortin, RNA Splicing, RNA, Messenger",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35775692/,"Department of Endocrine Genetics, Research Centre for Medical Genetics, 115522 Moscow, Russian Federation.; Endocrinology Research Centre, Moscow 117036, Russian Federation.; Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology of Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow 119991, Russian Federation.; Perm Regional Children's Clinical Hospital, Perm 614066, Russian Federation."
25858289,Indoor tanning and the MC1R genotype: risk prediction for basal cell carcinoma risk in young people.,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) incidence is increasing, particularly in young people, and can be associated with significant morbidity and treatment costs. To identify young individuals at risk of BCC, we assessed existing melanoma or overall skin cancer risk prediction models and built a novel risk prediction model, with a focus on indoor tanning and the melanocortin 1 receptor gene, MC1R. We evaluated logistic regression models among 759 non-Hispanic whites from a case-control study of patients seen between 2006 and 2010 in New Haven, Connecticut. In our data, the adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for a model by Han et al. (Int J Cancer. 2006;119(8):1976-1984) with 7 MC1R variants was 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66, 0.78), while that by Smith et al. (J Clin Oncol. 2012;30(15 suppl):8574) with MC1R and indoor tanning had an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.75). Our base model had greater predictive ability than existing models and was significantly improved when we added ever-indoor tanning, burns from indoor tanning, and MC1R (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.81). Our early-onset BCC risk prediction model incorporating MC1R and indoor tanning extends the work of other skin cancer risk prediction models, emphasizes the value of both genotype and indoor tanning in skin cancer risk prediction in young people, and should be validated with an independent cohort.","Molinaro Annette M, Ferrucci Leah M, Cartmel Brenda, Loftfield Erikka, Leffell David J, Bale Allen E, Mayne Susan T",American journal of epidemiology,2015,"Adult, Age Factors, Carcinoma, Basal Cell, Case-Control Studies, Connecticut, Educational Status, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genotype, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Pigmentation, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Sex Factors, Skin Neoplasms, Sunbathing, Time Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25858289/,
17222061,Distinct pigmentary and melanocortin 1 receptor-dependent components of cutaneous defense against ultraviolet radiation.,"Genetic variation at the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is an important risk factor for developing ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced skin cancer, the most common form of cancer in humans. The underlying mechanisms by which the MC1R defends against UV-induced skin cancer are not known. We used neonatal mouse skin (which, like human skin, contains a mixture of melanocytes and keratinocytes) to study how pigment cells and Mc1r genotype affect the genome-level response to UV radiation. Animals without viable melanocytes (Kit(W-v)/Kit(W-v)) or animals lacking a functional Mc1r (Mc1r(e)/Mc1r(e)) were exposed to sunburn-level doses of UVB radiation, and the patterns of large-scale gene expression in the basal epidermis were compared to each other and to nonmutant animals. Our analysis revealed discrete Kit- and Mc1r-dependent UVB transcriptional responses in the basal epidermis. The Kit-dependent UVB response was characterized largely by an enrichment of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress genes, highlighting a distinctive role for pigmented melanocytes in mediating antioxidant defenses against genotoxic stresses within the basal epidermal environment. By contrast, the Mc1r-dependent UVB response contained an abundance of genes associated with regulating the cell cycle and oncogenesis. To test the clinical relevance of these observations, we analyzed publicly available data sets for primary melanoma and melanoma metastases and found that the set of genes specific for the Mc1r-dependent UVB response was able to differentiate between different clinical subtypes. Our analysis also revealed that the classes of genes induced by UVB differ from those repressed by UVB with regard to their biological functions, their overall number, and their size. The findings described here offer new insights into the transcriptional nature of the UV response in the skin and provide a molecular framework for the underlying mechanisms by which melanocytes and the Mc1r independently mediate and afford protection against UV radiation.","April Craig S, Barsh Gregory S",PLoS genetics,2007,"Animals, Cell Cycle, Cluster Analysis, Epidermis, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, Neoplasm, Genotype, Humans, Melanocytes, Melanoma, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Models, Genetic, Pigmentation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Reproducibility of Results, Signal Transduction, Skin, Transcription, Genetic, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17222061/,"Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America."
23908401,MC1R and cAMP signaling inhibit cdc25B activity and delay cell cycle progression in melanoma cells.,"The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) mediates the tanning response through induction of cAMP and downstream pigmentary enzymes. Diminished function alleles of MC1R are associated with decreased tanning and increased melanoma risk, which has been attributed to increased rates of mutation. We have found that MC1R or cAMP signaling also directly decreases proliferation in melanoma cell lines. MC1R overexpression, treatment with the MC1R ligand, or treatment with small-molecule activators of cAMP signaling causes delayed progression from G2 into mitosis. This delay is caused by phosphorylation and inhibition of cdc25B, a cyclin dependent kinase 1-activating phosphatase, and is rescued by expression of a cdc25B mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at the serine 323 residue. These results show that MC1R and cAMP signaling can directly inhibit melanoma growth through regulation of the G2/M checkpoint.","Lyons Jesse, Bastian Boris C, McCormick Frank",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2013,"Blotting, Western, Cell Line, Tumor, Cyclic AMP, Flow Cytometry, G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints, Humans, Melanoma, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1, Signal Transduction, cdc25 Phosphatases",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23908401/,"Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA."
18282185,The Arg160Trp allele of melanocortin-1 receptor gene might protect against vitiligo.,"Melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) and agouti signaling protein (ASIP) play pivotal roles in the regulation of human pigmentation. We aimed to study whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MC1R and ASIP genes contribute to the pathogenesis of the polygenic pigment skin disorder, vitiligo. The PCR-amplified, full-length MC1R gene was studied with sequence analysis, and the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) SNP of ASIP was detected using restriction fragment length polymorphism. The allele frequency of the ASIP SNP did not show any difference between the skin type, hair color and eye color-matched 97 vitiligo patients and the 59 healthy control individuals. As one of the MC1R polymorphisms showed significantly higher incidence among fair-skinned individuals (Fitzpatrick I+II, n=140) than among dark-skinned individuals (Fitzpatrick III+IV, n=90), both vitiligo patients and controls were divided into two groups and the frequency of the MC1R alleles was studied separately in fair-skinned and dark-skinned subgroups of diseased and healthy groups. C478T, one of the MC1R SNPs studied in 108 fair-skinned vitiligo patients and in 70 fair-skinned healthy control individuals, showed a significant difference (P=0.0262, odds ratio [95% confidence interval]=3.6 [0.0046-0.1003]) in allele frequency between the two groups: the allele frequency was higher in the control group, suggesting protection against vitiligo.

We examined associations between cSCC invasiveness and 23 reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms among 67,833 non-Hispanic white subjects. Additionally, we performed a genome-wide scan and identified one SNP with significantly different frequencies in 5,724 subjects with at least one invasive tumor and 1,943 subjects with in situ tumors only. We then compared genotype frequencies among the invasive and in situ groups with those of 60,166 control subjects.

17651944,Gene expression analysis of melanocortin system in vitiligo.,"The melanocortin system in the skin coordinates pigmentation and immune response and could be implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. We aimed to analyze changes in expression of genes involved in skin pigmentation (melanocortin system and enzymes involved in melanin synthesis). With quantitative RT-PCR we measured the mRNA expression levels of eight genes from the melanocortin system and two enzymes involved in melanogenesis. RNA was extracted from both lesional and non-lesional skin of vitiligo patients and in non-sun-exposed skin of healthy subjects. POMC (proopiomelanocortin) expression was lower in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin. Expression of melanocortin receptors was increased in unaffected skin of vitiligo patients compared to healthy subjects and decreased in lesional skin compared to uninvolved skin of vitiligo patients, the differences were statistically significant in the cases of MC1R (melanocortin receptor 1) and MC4R (melanocortin receptor 4). TRP1 and DCT genes were down-regulated in lesional skin compared to non-lesional vitiligo skin or skin of healthy controls and up-regulated in uninvolved vitiligo skin compared to healthy control samples. In non-lesional skin, POMC expression was not elevated, possibly indicating that systemic influences are involved in up-regulation of MC receptor genes. Decreased expression of the analyzed genes in the lesional skin is not surprising, but statistically significant increased expression of studied genes in non-lesional skin from vitiligo patients is not described previously. In our mind, up-regulation of melanocortin system in non-lesional skin could be systemic compensation to restore normal pigmentation in lesions.","Kingo Külli, Aunin Eerik, Karelson Maire, Philips Mari-Anne, Rätsep Ranno, Silm Helgi, Vasar Eero, Soomets Ursel, Kõks Sulev",Journal of dermatological science,2007,"Adult, Aged, Agouti Signaling Protein, Agouti-Related Protein, Case-Control Studies, Female, Gene Expression, Humans, Male, Melanocortins, Middle Aged, Receptors, Melanocortin, Skin, Stress, Physiological, Vitiligo",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17651944/,"Department of Dermatology and Venerology, Centre of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, University of Tartu, Estonia."

The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, hair colour, eye colour, skin phototype and ancestry. We found that carriers of the R151C and R163Q variants were at an increased risk for melanoma OR 2.76 (1.59-4.78) and OR 5.62 (2.54-12.42), respectively. The risk of carrying RHC variants was 3.04 (1.90-4.86). Current study confirms the increased MM risk for R151C carriers.

The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic and certain allelic variants of the gene are associated with red hair phenotype, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The importance of the MC1R gene in determining skin cancer risk led us to examine the impact of specific polymorphisms in this gene on the responses of human melanocytes to alpha-melanotropin and UV radiation. We compared the ability of human melanocyte cultures, each derived from a single donor, to respond to alpha-melanotropin with dose-dependent stimulation of cAMP formation, tyrosinase activity and proliferation. In each of those cultures the MC1R gene was sequenced, and the eumelanin and pheomelanin contents were determined. Human melanocytes homozygous for Arg160Trp, heterozygous for Arg160Trp and Asp294His, or for Arg151Cys and Asp294His substitutions, but not melanocytes homozygous for Val92Met substitution, in the MC1R demonstrated a significantly reduced response to alpha-melanotropin. Additionally, melanocytes with a non-functional MC1R demonstrated a pronounced increase in their sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of UV radiation compared with melanocytes expressing functional MC1R. We conclude that loss-of-function mutations in the MC1R gene sensitize human melanocytes to the DNA damaging effects of UV radiation, which may increase skin cancer risk.","Scott M Cathy, Wakamatsu Kazumasa, Ito Shosuke, Kadekaro Ana Luisa, Kobayashi Nobuhiko, Groden Joanna, Kavanagh Renny, Takakuwa Takako, Virador Victoria, Hearing Vincent J, Abdel-Malek Zalfa A",Journal of cell science,2002,"Cell Death, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Cells, Cultured, Cyclic AMP, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Epidermis, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genotype, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Male, Melanins, Melanocytes, Monophenol Monooxygenase, Mutation, Polymorphism, Genetic, Receptors, Corticotropin, Receptors, Melanocortin, Skin Neoplasms, Ultraviolet Rays, alpha-MSH",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12006619/,"Department of Dermatology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, PO Box 670592, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267-0592, USA."
