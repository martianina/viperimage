29086472,Dermatological and environmental toxicological impact of the sunscreen ingredient oxybenzone/benzophenone-3.,"Oxybenzone (Benzophenone-3) is an emerging human and environmental contaminant used in sunscreens and personal care products to help minimize the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation. The Center for Disease Control fourth national report on human exposure to environmental chemicals demonstrated that approximately 97% of the people tested have oxybenzone present in their urine, and independent scientists have reported various concentrations in waterways and fish worldwide. Oxybenzone can also react with chlorine, producing hazardous by-products that can concentrate in swimming pools and wastewater treatment plants. Moreover, adverse reactions could very well be increased by the closed loop of ingesting fish contaminated with oxybenzone and/or washing the ingredient off our bodies and having it return in drinking water as treatment plants do not effectively remove the chemical as part of their processing protocols. In humans, oxybenzone has been reported to produce contact and photocontact allergy reactions, implemented as a possible endocrine disruptor and has been linked to Hirschsprung's disease. Environmentally, oxybenzone has been shown to produce a variety of toxic reactions in coral and fish ranging from reef bleaching to mortality. Lastly, with the rise in skin cancer rates and the availability of more effective sunscreen actives such as micronized zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, serious doubts about the relative prevention benefit of personal care products containing oxybenzone must be raised and compared with the potential negative health and environmental effects caused by the accumulation of this and other chemicals in the ecosystem.","DiNardo Joseph C, Downs Craig A",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,2018,"Animals, Benzophenones, Dermatitis, Irritant, Environmental Pollutants, Humans, Patch Tests, Risk Assessment, Sensitivity and Specificity, Skin Irritancy Tests, Skin Neoplasms, Sunburn, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29086472/,"Haereticus Environmental Laboratory, Clifford, VA, USA.; Research Scientist Emeritus, Vesuvius, VA, USA."
36805158,Benzophenone-3: Comprehensive review of the toxicological and human evidence with meta-analysis of human biomonitoring studies.,"Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and its major metabolite benzophenone-1 (BP-1) are widely used as UV filters in sunscreens and cosmetics to prevent sunburn and skin damage, or as stabilizers to prevent photodegradation in many commercial products. As a result, their presence is ubiquitous in the environment, wildlife and humans. Based on endocrine disruption concerns, international regulatory agencies are performing a closer evaluation. This work aimed to comprehensively review the available human relevant evidence for safety issues in MEDLINE/PubMed in order to create a structured database of studies, as well as to conduct an integrative analysis as part of the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) Initiative. A total of 1,635 titles and abstracts were screened and 254 references were evaluated and tabulated in detail, and classified in different categories: i) exposure sources and predictors; ii) human biomonitoring (HBM) exposure levels to perform a meta-analysis; iii) toxicokinetic data in both experimental animals and humans; iv) in vitro and in vivo rodent toxicity studies; and v) human data on effect biomarkers and health outcomes. Our integrative analysis showed that internal peak BP-3 concentrations achieved after a single whole-body application of a commercially available sunscreen (4% w/w) may overlap with concentrations eliciting endocrine disrupting effects in vitro, and with internal concentrations causing in vivo adverse female reproductive effects in rodents that were supported by still limited human data. The adverse effects in rodents included prolonged estrous cycle, altered uterine estrogen receptor gene expression, endometrium hyperplasia and altered proliferation and histology of the mammary gland, while human data indicated menstrual cycle hormonal alterations and increased risk of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. Among the modes of action reported (estrogenic, anti-androgenic, thyroid, etc.), BP-3 and especially BP-1 showed estrogenic activity at human-relevant concentrations, in agreement with the observed alterations in female reproductive endpoints. The meta-analysis of HBM studies identified a higher concern for North Americans, showing urinary BP-3 concentrations on average 10 and 20 times higher than European and Asian populations, respectively. Our work supports that these benzophenones present endocrine disrupting properties, endorsing recent European regulatory efforts to limit human exposure. The reproducible and comprehensive database generated may constitute a point of departure in future risk assessments to support regulatory initiatives. Meanwhile, individuals should not refrain from sunscreen use. Commercially available formulations using inorganic UV filters that are practically not absorbed into systemic circulation may be recommended to susceptible populations.","Mustieles Vicente, Balogh Ria K, Axelstad Marta, Montazeri Parisa, Márquez Sandra, Vrijheid Martine, Draskau Monica K, Taxvig Camilla, Peinado Francisco M, Berman Tamar, Frederiksen Hanne, Fernández Mariana F, Marie Vinggaard Anne, Andersson Anna-Maria",Environment international,2023,"Animals, Humans, Female, Sunscreening Agents, Biological Monitoring, Benzophenones, Cosmetics",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36805158/,"CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Spain; ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Environmental Health, Ministry of Health, Jerusalem 9101002, Israel.; Department of Growth and Reproduction, Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark; International Center for Research and Research Training in Endocrine Disruption of Male Reproduction and Child Health (EDMaRC), Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.; National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Kgs.

31041411,Skin safety and health prevention: an overview of chemicals in cosmetic products.,"Cosmetic products contain a wide range of chemicals to which we are exposed every day. The aim of the study was to determine the presence of potential dangerous substances which can cause adverse health effects by examining product labels. A total of 283 products were collected from various shops in Lecce (Italy) and divided into 3 categories: rinse-off, leave-on and make-up. The label of every product was examined and a list including fragrances, preservatives and other chemicals of concern was created. Fragrances were present in 52.3% of the examined products, mostly limonene (76.9%) and linalool (64.6%) but also citronellol (34.1%), geraniol (31.5%), coumarin (30%) and hexyl cinnamal (29.2%). Preservatives showed a rate of 60% and the most frequently identified were phenoxyethanol (48.7%), sodium benzoate (35.6%), potassium sorbate (22%), methylparaben (15.2%) and MI/MCI (9.9%). The other chemicals of concern were detected in 58% of products; included PEGs (62.3%), acrylate copolymer (34%), petrolatum (17.2%), polysorbates (14,8%), BHT (14.7%), ethylhextyl methoxycinnamate (13.6%), benzophenone-1 (3.7%), benzophenone-3 (4.9%), BHA (1.6%), cocamide DEA and toluene (1.2%). The use of many of these substances is allowed within certain limits, due to their toxicity at higher concentrations. Other important aspects should be considered as, for instance, the possibility of long-term effects. On the other hand, other substances may induce several acute adverse side-effects, i.e. contact dermatitis and allergic reactions. For these reasons, an enhancement of the criteria used for cosmetics formulation is required since many chemicals used singularly or combined are potentially unsafe.","Panico A, Serio F, Bagordo F, Grassi T, Idolo A, DE Giorgi M, Guido M, Congedo M, DE Donno A",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2019,"Allergens, Cosmetics, Humans, Odorants, Preservatives, Pharmaceutical, Skin Diseases",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31041411/,"Department of Biological and Environmental Science and Technology, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy.; Operating Unit of Dermatology, Vito Fazzi Hospital, Lecce, Italy."
28844799,Exposure to benzophenone-3 and reproductive toxicity: A systematic review of human and animal studies.,"Hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, also known as benzophenone-3 (BP-3), is a commonly used ultraviolet filter in skincare and as a food additive. Large concentrations of similar phenolic compounds have been detected in urine, amniotic fluid, and placental tissue, thereby raising questions about its impact on reproduction. The objective of this paper was to investigate the reproductive toxicity of BP-3 in humans and animals. In humans, studies showed that high levels of BP-3 exposure could be linked to an increase in male birth weight but a decline in female birth weight and male gestational age. In fish, BP-3 exposure resulted in a decline in egg production, hatching, and testosterone, along with a down-regulation of steroidogenic genes. In rats, a decrease in epididymal sperm density and a prolonged estrous cycle for females was observed. These positive associations may be attributed to an altered estrogen and testosterone balance as a result of endocrine disrupting effects of BP-3. However, the current body of literature is limited by non-uniform exposure and outcome measurements in studies both across and within species and future studies will need to be conducted in a standardized fashion to allow for a more significant contribution to the literature that allows for better comparison across studies.","Ghazipura Marya, McGowan Richard, Arslan Alan, Hossain Tanzib","Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)",2017,"Animals, Benzophenones, Endocrine Disruptors, Humans, Reproduction, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28844799/,"NYU Health Sciences Library, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.; NYU School of Medicine Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, New York, NY, United States.; NYU School of Medicine, Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Population Health, and Environmental Medicine, New York, NY, United States.; New York University (NYU) School of Medicine, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.

36209923,Associations between benzophenone-3 and sex steroid hormones among United States adult men.,"It has been demonstrated that benzophenone-3 is one of the endocrine-disrupting compounds which are considered as potential risk factors of adverse health effects. However, whether benzophenone-3 exposure can influence the sex steroid hormones levels remains unknown. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which is a cross-sectional dataset, from 2013 to 2016. A total of 1690 male US participants aged 18 or above were included. Urinary benzophenone-3, serum total testosterone, serum estradiol, serum sex hormone-binding globulin were measured. Confounders including age, body mass index, race, education level, urinary creatinine, ratio of family income to poverty, alcohol use, time of venipuncture, cardiac arterial diabetic score, energy intake, bisphenol A, triclosan and total parabens were controlled. After full adjustment (Model III), the upper benzophenone-3 quintiles had odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) of testosterone deficiency of 1.75 (1.03, 2.99), 2.47 (1.53, 3.98), 2.08 (1.13, 3.84) and 1.74 (0.94, 3.23) compared with quintile 1. Compared with quintile 1, percent changes (95 % confidence intervals) in testosterone were - 12 % (-19 %, -5 %) and - 9 % (-17 %, -1 %) for quintile 3 and quintile 5 in Model III. Estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin were generally similar to total testosterone in the associations with benzophenone-3. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that adult men in the US with higher urinary benzophenone-3 had a higher risk of testosterone deficiency and had inverse associations with total testosterone, estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin. To confirm the causal links between benzophenone-3 and sex steroid hormones, prospective studies are needed.","Tao Zhijun, Wang Zhongyuan, Zhu Shenhao, Wang Shangqian, Wang Zengjun","Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)",2022,"Adult, Humans, Male, Cross-Sectional Studies, Estradiol, Gonadal Steroid Hormones, Nutrition Surveys, Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin, Testosterone, United States, Endocrine Disruptors, Benzophenones",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36209923/,"Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, No.300, Guangzhou Street, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province 210029, China.; Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, No.300, Guangzhou Street, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province 210029, China.

32490822,Prenatal Exposure to Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and Asthma and Allergic Diseases.,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with endogenous hormones and are present in many consumer products. In addition, they affect the development and functions of the immune system. The prenatal period is critical, because exposure to EDCs can induce irreversible changes in the immune system and increase susceptibility to asthma and allergies later in life. Nonpersistent EDCs are of most concern owing to their high annual production and potential toxicity. In this review, we summarize the literature on the effects of prenatal exposure to nonpersistent EDCs-phthalates and phenols-on asthma and allergic diseases, describe the underlying biological mechanisms, and make recommendations. Between 2011 and 2020, a total of 19 prospective studies were published. Most of these were focused on phthalates and bisphenol A and few on other bisphenols, parabens, triclosan, and benzophenone-3. Evidence remains insufficient owing to differences in chemical use between countries, sociodemographic characteristics of the study populations, misclassification of exposure due to the high within-subject variability, and heterogeneity in the definition of health outcomes. EDCs can alter airway cell differentiation and gut microbiota, shift the immune response towards TH2, alter expression of T regulatory cells and TH17, and weaken innate immunity. In order to better understand the burden of EDCs on the respiratory and immune systems, we require thoughtfully designed studies to assess exposure, appropriately characterize asthma and allergic phenotypes, and evaluate biological mechanisms and EDC mixtures.","Casas Maribel, Gascon M",Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology,2020,"Asthma, Endocrine Disruptors, Environmental Exposure, Female, Humans, Hypersensitivity, Immunity, Innate, Pregnancy, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Th2 Cells",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32490822/,"ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain."
30484882,Sunscreen bans: Coral reefs and skin cancer.,"Hawaii will ban two major ingredients of sunscreens. This article reviews the reasons and future directions. Hawaii recently enacted legislation that will ban the use of two major ingredients of the majority of commonly used sunscreens. The reason for the ban is the ingredients' putative deleterious impact on marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. But sunscreens also save lives by decreasing the risk of UV-induced skin cancers. We review both sides of the issue and potential implications for the healthcare system. Coral reefs consist of organisms in delicate equilibria that are susceptible to small changes in their surroundings. Recent natural and man-made disruptions, direct or indirect, such as changes in ocean temperature and chemistry, ingress of invasive species, pathogens, pollution and deleterious fishing practices, have been blamed for the poor health, or even the outright destruction, of some coral reefs. The most popular sunscreen products contain two ingredients-oxybenzone and octinoxate-that have also been implicated in coral toxicity and will be banned. This creates a healthcare dilemma: Will the protection of coral reefs result in an increase in human skin cancers? Concentration estimates and mechanism studies support an association-direct or indirect (via promotion of viral infection)-of sunscreens with bleaching of coral reefs. A ban on the two most common sunscreen ingredients goes into effect in Hawaii on January 1, 2021. Proponents suggest that this is a trend, just the first of many such bans worldwide; opponents warn of a dire increase in human skin cancers. As a result, alternative sunscreen compounds are being sought.","Raffa Robert B, Pergolizzi Joseph V, Taylor Robert, Kitzen Jan M, ",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,2019,"Animals, Anthozoa, Benzophenones, Cinnamates, Consumer Product Safety, Coral Reefs, Hawaii, Humans, Skin Neoplasms, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30484882/,"Kitzen Pharmaceutical Consulting, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.; NEMA Research, Inc., Naples, Florida.; Neumentum, Inc., Palo Alto, California.; University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, Tucson, Arizona."
29615064,Childhood and adolescent phenol and phthalate exposure and the age of menarche in Latina girls.,"The age of menarche has been associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disease, as well as cancer risk. The decline in menarcheal age over the past century may be partially attributable to increased exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). We assessed the influence of 26 phenol and phthalate biomarkers on the timing of menarche in a longitudinal cohort of Chilean girls. These EDCs were quantified in urine collected prior to the onset of breast development (Tanner 1; B1), and during adolescence (Tanner 4; B4). Multivariable accelerated failure time (AFT) models were used to analyze associations between biomarker concentrations and the age of menarche adjusting for body mass index (BMI) Z-score and maternal education, accounting for within-subject correlation. Several biomarkers were significantly associated with the age at menarche; however, these associations were dependent on the timing of biomarker assessment. A log(ng/ml) increase in B1 concentrations of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate biomarkers was associated with later menarche (hazard ratio (HR): 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.98), whereas higher B1 concentrations of 2,5-dichlorophenol and benzophenone-3 were associated with earlier menarche (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.27; HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29, respectively). Elevated B4 concentrations of monomethyl phthalate were similarly associated with earlier menarche (HR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.53). The impact of monoethyl phthalate and triclosan concentrations on pubertal timing were significantly modified by BMI Z-score. Higher monoethyl phthalate and triclosan concentrations were associated with earlier menarche among overweight or obese girls, but not among those that were normal weight. This study identifies modulation of sexual maturation by specific EDC biomarkers in Latina girls.","Binder Alexandra M, Corvalan Camila, Calafat Antonia M, Ye Xiaoyun, Mericq Verónica, Pereira Ana, Michels Karin B",Environmental health : a global access science source,2018,"Adolescent, Age Factors, Child, Chile, Endocrine Disruptors, Environmental Exposure, Environmental Pollutants, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Menarche, Phenols, Phthalic Acids, Sexual Maturation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29615064/,"Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. k.michels@ucla.edu.; Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Institute of Maternal and Child Research, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.; Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile."
29156601,Acute Toxicity and Ecological Risk Assessment of Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and Benzophenone-4 (BP-4) in Ultraviolet (UV)-Filters.,"Ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing chemicals (UV filters) are used in personal care products for the protection of human skin and hair from damage by UV radiation. Although these substances are released into the environment in the production and consumption processes, little is known about their ecotoxicology effects. The acute toxicity and potential ecological risk of UV filters benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and benzophenone-4 (BP-4) on <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>, <i>Daphnia magna</i>, and <i>Brachydanio rerio</i> were analyzed in the present study. The EC<sub>50</sub> values (96 h) of BP-3 and BP-4 on <i>C. vulgaris</i> were 2.98 and 201.00 mg/L, respectively. The 48 h-LC<sub>50</sub> of BP-3 and BP-4 on <i>D. magna</i> were 1.09 and 47.47 mg/L, respectively. The 96 h-LC<sub>50</sub> of BP-3 and BP-4 on <i>B. rerio</i> were 3.89 and 633.00 mg/L, respectively. The toxicity of a mixture of BP-3 and BP-4 on <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>D. magna</i>, and <i>B. rerio</i> all showed antagonistic effects. The induced predicted no-effect concentrations of BP-3 and BP-4 by the assessment factor method were 1.80 × 10<sup>-3</sup> and 0.47 mg/L, respectively, by assessment factor (AF) method, which were both lower than the concentrations detected in the environment at present, verifying that BP-3 and BP-4 remain low-risk chemicals to the aquatic ecosystem.","Du Yang, Wang Wen-Qian, Pei Zhou-Tao, Ahmad Fahmi, Xu Rou-Rou, Zhang Yi-Min, Sun Li-Wei",International journal of environmental research and public health,2017,"Animals, Benzophenones, Chlorella vulgaris, Daphnia, Ecotoxicology, Environmental Monitoring, Humans, Risk Assessment, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Zebrafish, Zebrafish Proteins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29156601/,"Research Center of Watershed Ecological Conservation and Water Pollution Control, Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences, Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China, Nanjing 210042, China. zym@nies.org.; School of Energy & Environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210042, China. 220150552@seu.edu.cn.; School of Energy & Environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210042, China. 220160595@seu.edu.cn.; School of Energy & Environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210042, China. 220170623@seu.edu.cn.; School of Energy & Environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210042, China. ahmad.fahmi@rocketmail.com.; School of Energy & Environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210042, China. liwei-sun@seu.edu.cn.; School of Energy & Environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210042, China. zt746603025@gmail.com."
36346334,Urinary phenol concentrations and fecundability and early pregnancy loss.,"Are urinary phenol concentrations of methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, triclosan, benzophenone-3, 2,4-dichlorophenol or 2,5-dichlorophenol associated with fecundability and early pregnancy loss? 2,5-dichlorophenol concentrations were associated with an increased odds of early pregnancy loss, and higher concentrations of butylparaben and triclosan were associated with an increase in fecundability. Phenols are chemicals with endocrine-disrupting potential found in everyday products. Despite plausible mechanisms of phenol reproductive toxicity, there are inconsistent results across few epidemiologic studies examining phenol exposure and reproductive function in non-fertility treatment populations. Specimens and data were from the North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study prospective cohort of 221 women attempting to conceive naturally from 1982 to 1986. This analysis includes data from 221 participants across 706 menstrual cycles, with 135 live births, 15 clinical miscarriages and 48 early pregnancy losses (before 42 days after the last menstrual period). Participants collected daily first-morning urine specimens. For each menstrual cycle, aliquots from three daily specimens across the cycle were pooled within individuals and analyzed for phenol concentrations. To assess sample repeatability, we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for each phenol. We evaluated associations between phenol concentrations from pooled samples and time to pregnancy using discrete-time logistic regression and generalized estimating equations (GEE), and early pregnancy loss using multivariable logistic regression and GEE. ICCs for within-person variability across menstrual cycles in pooled phenol concentrations ranged from 0.42 to 0.75. There was an increased odds of early pregnancy loss with 2,5-dichlorophenol concentrations although the CIs were wide (5th vs 1st quintile odds ratio (OR): 4.79; 95% CI: 1.06, 21.59). There was an increased per-cycle odds of conception at higher concentrations of butylparaben (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.44) and triclosan (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.99, 2.26) compared to non-detectable concentrations. No associations were observed between these endpoints and concentrations of other phenols examined. Limitations include the absence of phenol measurements for male partners and a limited sample size, especially for the outcome of early pregnancy loss, which reduced our power to detect associations. This study is the first to use repeated pooled measures to summarize phenol exposure and the first to investigate associations with fecundability and early pregnancy loss. Within-person phenol concentration variability underscores the importance of collecting repeated samples for future studies. Exposure misclassification could contribute to differences between the findings of this study and those of other studies, all of which used one urine sample to assess phenol exposure. This study also contributes to the limited literature probing potential associations between environmental exposures and early pregnancy loss, which is a challenging outcome to study as it typically occurs before a pregnancy is clinically recognized.

39954436,Biotransformation of oxybenzone and 3-(4-methylbenzylidene)camphor in Cunninghamella species: Potential for environmental clean-up of widely used sunscreen agents.,"The extensive use of organic UV filters (OUVFs) has led to these compounds being ubiquitously detected in the environment and considered a new kind of environmental pollutant. As OUVFs cannot be efficiently eliminated by conventional treatment processes, there is an urgent need to develop new innovative solutions for their removal. The present work investigates the efficacy of three Cunninghamella strains in the biodegradation of OUVFs: oxybenzone (BP-3) and 3-(4-methylbenzylidene)camphor (4-MBC). Moreover, a cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibition study was conducted, and Cunninghamella-processed samples in silico and in vitro toxicity were evaluated. Our results indicated the ability of Cunninghamella strains to utilize OUVFs. Among the tested Cunninghamella strains, both agents were the most efficiently removed by C. blakesleeana. These results were comparable with A. niger biodegradation capacity. In vitro studies of the fungi-processed samples confirmed no mutagenicity in the Ames test and the lack of cytotoxicity against HepG2 cell line. Moreover, Cunninghamella treatment positively influenced OUVFs SH-SY5Y neurotoxicity and ecotoxicity. After fungal treatment, BP-3 agonistic estrogenic activity was higher, whereas antagonistic androgenic effect was lower than before biotransformation. 4-MBC, after biotransformation, lost agonistic estrogenic activity, but gained antagonistic estrogenic properties. Additionally, this study confirmed the involvement of CYP450 enzymes in BP-3 and 4-MBC biotransformation, thus contributing to a better understanding of the detoxification pathways of OUVFs in fungi. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated, for the first time, that using environmental fungi Cunninghamella for the biodegradation of BP-3 and 4-MBC represents a potent approach for eliminating contaminants from the natural environment.","Murzyn Aleksandra, Popiół Justyna, Gunia-Krzyżak Agnieszka, Żelaszczyk Dorota, Dąbrówka Barbara, Koczurkiewicz-Adamczyk Paulina, Piska Kamil, Żmudzki Paweł, Pękala Elżbieta, Słoczyńska Karolina",Journal of hazardous materials,2025,"Sunscreening Agents, Benzophenones, Humans, Biotransformation, Camphor, Biodegradation, Environmental, Cell Survival, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Hep G2 Cells, Environmental Pollutants",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39954436/,"Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Chair of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Medyczna 9, Kraków 30-688, Poland.

21392107,Current sunscreen controversies: a critical review.,"Sunscreens are believed to be a valuable tool in providing photoprotection against the detrimental effects of UV radiation, a known carcinogen. However, a number of controversies have developed regarding their safety and efficacy. This review summarizes the relevant studies surrounding these controversies. Evidence of the prevention of skin cancer, an oft-cited reason for sunscreen use, was examined as it pertains to squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. We also reviewed studies examining the effects of sunscreen on the synthesis of vitamin D, an essential nutrient whose role in health and disease continues to grow. Lastly, we analyzed studies surrounding the safety and toxicity of oxybenzone, retinyl palmitate and nanoparticles of zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2 ). The overwhelming majority of available data is drawn from studies conducted using antiquated sunscreen formulations. Nonetheless, our research revealed that topical use of sunscreen protects against squamous cell carcinoma, does not cause vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in practice and has not been demonstrated to adversely affect the health of humans. Given the established benefits of UV protection, the use of sunscreens remains an important part of an overall photoprotective strategy. Future sunscreens with improved formulation should ideally offer superior protection. With increased usage of sunscreen by the public, continuous and vigilant monitoring of the overall safety of future products is also needed.","Burnett Mark E, Wang Steven Q","Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine",2011,"Animals, Carcinoma, Basal Cell, Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, Humans, Skin Neoplasms, Sunscreening Agents, Vitamin D Deficiency",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21392107/,"Dermatology Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10022, USA."
34456215,Evaluating the Sun Protection Factor of Cosmetic Formulations Containing Afzelin.,"Exposure to UV radiation damages the skin and increases the risk of skin cancer. Sunscreen is used to protect the skin from the harmful effects of UV radiation. However, the chemical UV filters used in sunscreen can show toxicity and cause allergic reactions. A safe sunscreen that includes a lower content of chemical UV filters and exerts an excellent effect on UV protection needs to be developed. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the addition of afzelin to sunscreen could improve the sun protection factor (SPF). A synergistic effect between afzelin and organic sunscreen agents including padimate O and oxybenzone was confirmed. Interestingly, 100% in vitro SPF-boosting was observed when afzelin (0.05%) was applied with a standard SPF formulation containing organic sunscreens while afzelin alone had no contribution to the SPF. In vivo SPF analysis of the standard SPF formulation showed an SPF value of 13.3 that increased to 20.1 when supplemented with afzelin (0.05%). Additionally, afzelin showed no skin irritation in a human trial. These results suggest that afzelin is useful as a natural additive in sunscreen formulations and provides an SPF-boosting effect. Afzelin supplementation to the formulation showed the potential to reduce the use of synthetic photoprotectors, which could minimize the risk of synthetic agent toxicity.","Kim Minkyung, Shin Seoungwoo, Ryu Dehun, Cho Eunae, Yoo Jiseon, Park Deokhoon, Jung Eunsun",Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,2021,"Adolescent, Adult, Benzophenones, Clinical Trials as Topic, Cosmetics, Drug Compounding, Female, Humans, Male, Mannosides, Middle Aged, Proanthocyanidins, Skin, Sun Protection Factor, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays, para-Aminobenzoates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34456215/,Biospectrum Life Science Institute.

To maximize compliance, adverse reactions to sunscreens should be minimized. Although inactive ingredients cause many of these reactions, it is important for dermatologists to be aware of reactions to active ultraviolet filters. There are approximately 120 chemicals that can function as ultraviolet (UV) filters. This review focuses on the 36 most common filters in commercial and historical use. Of these, 16 are approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. The benzophenones and dibenzoylmethanes are the most commonly implicated UV filters causing allergic and photoallergic contact dermatitis (PACD) reactions; benzophenone-3 is the leading allergen and photoallergen within this class.

35690277,Toward a digital analysis of environmental impacts on rodent mammary gland density during critical developmental windows.,"While mammographic breast density is associated with breast cancer risk in humans, there is no comparable surrogate risk measure in mouse and rat mammary glands following various environmental exposures. In the current study, mammary glands from mice and rats subjected to reproductive factors and exposures to environmental chemicals that have been shown to influence mammary gland development and/or susceptibility to mammary tumors were evaluated for histologic density by manual and automated digital methods. Digital histological density detected changes due to hormonal stimuli/reproductive factors (parity), dietary fat, and exposure to environmental chemicals, such as benzophenone-3 and a combination of perfluorooctanoic acid and zeranol. Thus, digital analysis of mammary gland density offers a high throughput method that can provide a highly reproducible means of comparing a measure of histological density across independent experiments, experimental systems, and laboratories. This methodology holds promise for the detection of environmental impacts on mammary gland structure in mice and rats that may be comparable to human breast density, thus potentially allowing comparisons between rodent models and human breast cancer studies.","Hamilton Alina M, Olsson Linnea T, Midkiff Bentley R, Morozova Elena, Su Yanrong, Haslam Sandra Z, Vandenberg Laura N, Schneider Sallie S, Santucci-Pereira Julia, Jerry D Joseph, Troester Melissa A, Schwartz Richard C","Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)",2022,"Animals, Breast Density, Breast Neoplasms, Environment, Female, Humans, Mammary Glands, Animal, Mice, Pregnancy, Rats, Rodentia",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35690277/,"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.

22612478,Sunscreens: are they beneficial for health? An overview of endocrine disrupting properties of UV-filters.,"Today, topical application of sunscreens, containing ultraviolet-filters (UV-filters), is preferred protection against adverse effects of ultraviolet radiation. Evidently, use of sunscreens is effective in prevention of sunburns in various models. However, evidence for their protective effects against melanoma skin cancer is less conclusive. Three important observations prompted us to review the animal data and human studies on possible side effects of selected chemical UV-filters in cosmetics. (1) the utilization of sunscreens with UV-filters is increasing worldwide; (2) the incidence of the malignant disorder for which sunscreens should protect, malignant melanoma, is rapidly increasing and (3) an increasing number of experimental studies indicating that several UV-filters might have endocrine disruptive effects. The selected UV-filters we review in this article are benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 3-benzylidene camphor (3-BC), 3-(4-methyl-benzylidene) camphor (4-MBC), 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxy cinnamate (OMC), Homosalate (HMS), 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (OD-PABA) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). The potential adverse effects induced by UV-filters in experimental animals include reproductive/developmental toxicity and disturbance of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT). Few human studies have investigated potential side effects of UV-filters, although human exposure is high as UV-filters in sunscreens are rapidly absorbed from the skin. One of the UV-filters, BP-3, has been found in 96% of urine samples in the US and several UV-filters in 85% of Swiss breast milk samples. It seems pertinent to evaluate whether exposure to UV-filters contribute to possible adverse effects on the developing organs of foetuses and children.","Krause M, Klit A, Blomberg Jensen M, Søeborg T, Frederiksen H, Schlumpf M, Lichtensteiger W, Skakkebaek N E, Drzewiecki K T",International journal of andrology,2012,"4-Aminobenzoic Acid, Animals, Benzyl Compounds, Camphor, Cinnamates, Endocrine Disruptors, Humans, Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System, Melanoma, Receptors, Estrogen, Salicylates, Skin Neoplasms, Sunburn, Sunscreening Agents, Thyroid Gland, Ultraviolet Rays, para-Aminobenzoates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22612478/,"Department of Growth and Reproduction, University of Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark."
35630736,Enhanced Toxicity of Bisphenols Together with UV Filters in Water: Identification of Synergy and Antagonism in Three-Component Mixtures.,"Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) localize in the biome in variable combinations of complex mixtures that are often environmentally persistent, bioaccumulate and biomagnify, prompting a need for extensive monitoring. Many cosmetics include UV filters that are listed as CECs, such as benzophenone derivatives (oxybenzone, OXYB), cinnamates (2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate, EMC) and camphor derivatives (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, 4MBC). Furthermore, in numerous water sources, these UV filters have been detected together with Bisphenols (BPs), which are commonly used in plastics and can be physiologically detrimental. We utilized bioluminescent bacteria (Microtox assay) to monitor these CEC mixtures at environmentally relevant doses, and performed the first systematic study involving three sunscreen components (OXYB, 4MBC and EMC) and three BPs (BPA, BPS or BPF). Moreover, a breast cell line and cell viability assay were employed to determine the possible effect of these mixtures on human cells. Toxicity modeling, with concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) approaches, was performed, followed by data interpretation using Model Deviation Ratio (MDR) evaluation. The results show that UV filter sunscreen constituents and BPs interact at environmentally relevant concentrations. Of notable interest, mixtures containing any pair of three BPs (e.g., BPA + BPS, BPA + BPF and BPS + BPF), together with one sunscreen component (OXYB, 4MBC or EMC), showed strong synergy or overadditive effects. On the other hand, mixtures containing two UV filters (any pair of OXYB, 4MBC and EMC) and one BP (BPA, BPS or BPF) had a strong propensity towards concentration dependent underestimation. The three-component mixtures of UV filters (4MBC, EMC and OXYB) acted in an antagonistic manner toward each other, which was confirmed using a human cell line model. This study is one of the most comprehensive involving sunscreen constituents and BPs in complex mixtures, and provides new insights into potentially important interactions between these compounds.","Kudłak Błażej, Jatkowska Natalia, Liu Wen, Williams Michael J, Barcelo Damia, Schiöth Helgi B","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,"Camphor, Complex Mixtures, Humans, Sunscreening Agents, Water, Water Pollutants, Chemical",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35630736/,"Catalan Institute for Water Research (ICRA), Parc Científic i Tecnològic de la Universitat de Girona, C/Emili Grahit, 101 Edifici H2O, E-17003 Girona, Spain.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Gdańsk University of Technology, 11/12 Narutowicza Str., 80-233 Gdańsk, Poland.; Functional Pharmacology, Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, 751 24 Uppsala, Sweden."
39520751,Benzophenone-3 exposure induced apoptosis via impairing mitochondrial function in human chondrocytes.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease affecting millions of adults worldwide, characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage. Many environmental risk factors contribute to OA development. Benzophenone-3 (BP-3), a commonly used ultraviolet filter in personal care products, has been positively associated with OA risk. However, it remains unclear whether and how BP-3 induces toxic effects on articular chondrocytes and promote OA development. This study aims to investigate the damage of BP-3 at environmentally relevant concentrations to human chondrocytes, as well as potential mechanisms linking BP-3 with injury of chondrocytes. Notably, BP-3 significantly inhibited cell viability, induced apoptosis, and up-regulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and 13 which mediated cartilage degradation in C28/I2 human normal chondrocytes. Moreover, the function of mitochondria was impaired and oxidative stress occurred in BP-3 exposure groups, evidenced by elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, decrease of ATP production and inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, II, III and IV. Meanwhile, BP-3 caused mitochondrial cristae vague and formation of autophagosomes. PTEN induced putative kinase 1/E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PINK1/Parkin) pathway was also activated by BP-3. Addition of autophagy inhibitor, 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), suppressed PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, but increased BP-3-induced expression of MMP1 and 13, as well as exacerbated BP-3-induced apoptosis, suggesting mitophagy may exert a chondroprotective effect and partially alleviate apoptosis induced by this compound. In brief, BP-3 exposure may increase OA risk via inducing apoptosis and increasing breakdown of extracellular matrix in chondrocytes, and mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy may play a crucial role in the mechanisms of BP-3-induced toxicity to articular chondrocytes.","Yang Ye, Gao Rui, Zhu Zhenyu, Xiao Wenfeng, Wang Jing, Zhao Wenxia, Li Yingjun",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2024,"Chondrocytes, Humans, Apoptosis, Mitochondria, Benzophenones, Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial, Osteoarthritis, Cell Survival, Oxidative Stress, Reactive Oxygen Species, Autophagy, Protein Kinases, Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39520751/,"School of Public Health, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310013, China.; School of Public Health, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310013, China.

FP-6 enhances phytoremediation of benzophenone-3 through regulating soil microbial community, increasing photosynthetic capacity and maintaining redox homeostasis of plant.","Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) has attracted widespread attention due to its large accumulation in the environment and its potential toxicity effects to human. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the combined application of tobacco and Methylophilus sp. strain FP-6 with both plant growth promoting (PGP) traits and BP-3 degradation function on BP-3 remediation in soil. The results showed that about 79.18% of BP-3 was removed from the soil after 30 days of plant culture inoculated with the FP-6 strain, which was significantly higher than the plant-alone treatment. Simultaneously, inoculation with strain FP-6 significantly improved growth performance, biomass production, antioxidant levels, osmoregulation substance, photosynthetic capacity and chlorophyll accumulation in tobacco. Moreover, the application of FP-6 shifted the bacterial community, and enhanced the abundance of BP-3-degrading or soil nutrient cycling-affecting bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, Bryobacter, MND1 and Myxococcales), which might be valuable for the promotion of plant growth and degradation of BP-3 in the soil. The results from this study gave first insights into the enhancement of BP-3 removal efficiency from soil by phytoremediation assisted with bacteria possessing both PGP properties and BP-3 degradation function.

In this study, EpiDerm™ was used to assess skin irritation by oxybenzone and N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), which are widely used sunscreen and insect repellent components, respectively. EpiDerm™ was applied with oxybenzone and DEET, combined and sequentially with each single dose. Epidermal morphology and differentiation/proliferation were examined microscopically. Oxybenzone and sequential administration groups were determined as nonirritant with cell viability >50% and the morphology was comparable to the human epidermis. Contrastingly, the DEET and coadministration groups exhibited cell viability <50% and poor epidermal morphology. Interleukin (IL)-1α release from substance-treated EpiDerm™ increased inversely to cell viability, suggesting the pro-inflammatory reaction was initiated by DEET. CK-10, E-cadherin, Ki-67, laminin, and ceramide were identified as relevant markers to assess oxybenzone- or DEET-induced epidermal injury.

11702366,Assessment and clinical implications of absorption of sunscreens across skin.,"Topical sunscreen products are widely used for protection of the skin against the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Sunscreen agents are incorporated into many everyday-use cosmetics as well as so called 'beach' products. An ideal sunscreen product will provide effective protection against UV radiation with minimal skin absorption of the active ingredients. There is now clear evidence that a common sunscreen chemical, benzophenone-3, is absorbed systemically following topical application to the skin. Other more lipophilic sunscreens are absorbed into the skin, but penetration to deeper tissues and the cutaneous circulation appears to be limited. However, the extent to which sunscreens that are absorbed into the stratum corneum are absorbed to deeper tissues and the systemic circulation over time is currently unknown. The formulation vehicle in which the sunscreen is presented to the skin has a significant effect on absorption into and through the skin. Alcohol-based formulations appear to increase sunscreen absorption. In addition, some sunscreen chemicals may enhance the skin absorption of other sunscreens when applied in combination. Clearly, further research into the influence of sunscreen and formulation properties on skin absorption could lead to optimal design of sunscreen products with respect to efficacy and minimizing absorption. Despite the extensive use of sunscreen products, there have been few reports of adverse effects, and these tend to be limited to acute dermatitis and allergies. Some recent reports have raised concerns that sunscreen chemicals may damage tissues, particularly in the presence of UV radiation. Further research into the toxicity of sunscreens is urgently required. Given the information currently available and the importance of protecting the skin against sun damage, there is no clear justification for restricting the use of sunscreen products at this time.",Benson H A,American journal of clinical dermatology,2000,"Absorption, Humans, Skin, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11702366/,"Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. hbenson@ms.umanitoba.ca"
36822008,Human risk associated with exposure to mixtures of antiandrogenic chemicals evaluated using in vitro hazard and human biomonitoring data.,"Scientific evidence for underestimated toxicity from unintentional exposure to chemical mixtures is mounting. Yet, harmonized approaches on how to assess the actual risk of mixtures is lacking. As part of the European Joint programme 'Human Biomonitoring for Europe' we explored a novel methodology for mixture risk assessment of chemicals affecting male reproductive function. We explored a methodology for chemical mixture risk assessment based on human in vitro data combined with human exposure data, thereby circumventing the drawbacks of using hazard data from rodents and estimated exposure intake levels. Human androgen receptor (hAR) antagonism was selected as the most important molecular initiating event linked to adverse outcomes on male reproductive health. Our work identified 231 chemicals able to interfere with hAR activity. Among these were 61 finally identified as having both reliable hAR antagonist and human biomonitoring data. Calculation of risk quotients indicated that PCBs (118, 138, 157), phthalates (BBP, DBP, DIBP), benzophenone-3, PFOS, methylparaben, triclosan, some pesticides (i.e cypermethrin, β-endosulfan, methylparathion, p,p-DDE), and a PAH metabolite (1-hydroxypyrene) contributed to the mixture effect. The major chemical mixture drivers were PCB 118, BBP, PFOS, DBP, and the UV filter benzophenone-3, together contributing with 75% of the total mixture effect that was primarily driven by high exposure values. This viable way forward for mixture risk assessment of chemicals has the advantages of (1) being a more comprehensive mixture risk assessment also covering data-poor chemicals, and (2) including human data only. However, the approach is subjected to uncertainties in terms of in vitro to in vivo extrapolation, it is not ready for decision making, and needs further development. Still, the results indicate a concern for adverse effects on reproductive function in highly exposed boys, especially when considering additional exposure to data-poor chemicals and chemicals acting by other mechanisms of action.","Ma Yanying, Taxvig Camilla, Rodríguez-Carrillo Andrea, Mustieles Vicente, Reiber Lena, Kiesow Anja, Löbl Nathalie Michelle, Fernández Mariana F, Hansen Tina Vicky Alstrup, Valente Maria João, Kolossa-Gehring Marike, David Madlen, Vinggaard Anne Marie",Environment international,2023,"Humans, Male, Biological Monitoring, Benzophenones, Androgen Receptor Antagonists, Pesticides, Risk Assessment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36822008/,"Center for Biomedical Research (CIBM), University of Granada, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Biosanitaria Ibs Granada, Spain.; Center for Biomedical Research (CIBM), University of Granada, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Biosanitaria Ibs Granada, Spain; Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology & Public Health (CIBERESP), 18100, Spain.; German Environment Agency, Berlin, Germany.; National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, 2800 Kgs.

37561120,Comparison between endocrine activity assessed using ToxCast/Tox21 database and human plasma concentration of sunscreen active ingredients/UV filters.,"Sunscreen products are composed of ultraviolet (UV) filters and formulated to reduce exposure to sunlight thereby lessening skin damage. Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity and potential endocrine disrupting (ED) effects of UV filters. The ToxCast/Tox21 program, that is, CompTox, is a high-throughput in vitro screening database of chemicals that identify adverse outcome pathways, key events, and ED potential of chemicals. Using the ToxCast/Tox21 database, octisalate, homosalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and avobenzone, 6 commonly used organic UV filters, were found to have been evaluated. These UV filters showed low potency in these bioassays with most activity detected above the range of the cytotoxic burst. The pathways that were most affected were the cell cycle and the nuclear receptor pathways. Most activity was observed in liver and kidney-based bioassays. These organic filters and their metabolites showed relatively weak ED activity when tested in bioassays measuring estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), thyroid receptor, and steroidogenesis activity. Except for oxybenzone, all activity in the endocrine assays occurred at concentrations greater than the cytotoxic burst. Moreover, except for oxybenzone, plasma concentrations (Cmax) measured in humans were at least 100× lower than bioactive (AC50/ACC) concentrations that produced a response in ToxCast/Tox21 assays. These data are consistent with in vivo animal/human studies showing weak or negligible endocrine activity. In sum, when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence assessment and compared with measured plasma concentrations, the results show these organic UV filters have low intrinsic biological activity and risk of toxicity including endocrine disruption in humans.","Onyango David O, Selman Bastian G, Rose Jane L, Ellison Corie A, Nash J F",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,2023,"Animals, Humans, Sunscreening Agents, Benzophenones, Receptors, Estrogen",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37561120/,"Global Product Stewardship, The Procter & Gamble Company, Mason, Ohio 45040, USA."
30488083,Contradictory effects of chemical filters in UV/ROS-stressed human keratinocyte and fibroblast cells.,"Chemical UV-filters are frequently applied as active ingredients in sunscreen to protect from detrimental effects of UV radiation. Regardless, many of these compounds are not well characterized concerning their capacity to counteract UV induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intracellular ROS release is an early event upon UV exposure and a crucial trigger of reaction cascades that may provoke adverse effects both in short- and long-term. We report a strategy to assess the capacity of UV-filters (ecamsule, oxybenzone and menthyl anthranilate) to counteract UVA/UVB stress in the human keratinocyte HaCaT and the wildtype Fibs E6/E7 fibroblast cell lines. The reduction of ROS levels was taken as primary endpoint. The effect of treatment on the cells' metabolic activity was analyzed as an indicator of viability post-treatment, to investigate potential immediate and late (photo)toxicity. Additionally, the compounds' antioxidative capacity was investigated using an azo-based radical generator. Established antioxidants, quercetin and N-acetylcysteine, were used as controls. Data showed remarkable differences in the mode of action of the chemical UV-filters, ranging from protective to pro-oxidative properties, indicating the need for more detailed mode of action-based investigations. Certainly, additional consideration and evaluation will be necessary to further extrapolate these in vitro data for the assessment of in vivo exposure situations. However, the presented approach enables parallel investigations of photoprotective and phototoxic effects of UV-filters, and thus can complement and extent existing in vitro testing strategies.","Hofer Stefanie, Stonig Marlies, Wally Verena, Hartmann Anja, Fuchs Dietmar, Hermann Martin, Paparella Martin, Ganzera Markus, Gostner Johanna M",ALTEX,2019,"Cell Line, Fibroblasts, Humans, Keratinocytes, Oxidative Stress, Radiation-Protective Agents, Reactive Oxygen Species, Skin, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30488083/,"Department of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.; Division of Biological Chemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.; Division of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.; EB House Austria, Research Program for Molecular Therapy of Genodermatoses, Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Austria.; Institute of Pharmacy/Pharmacognosy, University of Innsbruck, Austria."

37279611,"Exposure of Swedish adolescents to elements, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and rapidly excreted substances - The Riksmaten adolescents 2016-17 national survey.","Adolescence is a period of significant physiological changes, and likely a sensitive window to chemical exposure. Few nation-wide population-based studies of chemical body burdens in adolescents have been published. In the national dietary survey Riksmaten Adolescents (RMA) 2016-17, over 13 chemical substance groups, including elements, chlorinated/brominated/fluorinated persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were analysed in blood, and in urine metabolites of phthalates/phthalate alternatives, phosphorous flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and pesticides, along with bisphenols and biocide/preservative/antioxidant/UV filter substances (N = 1082, ages 11-21). The aim was to characterize the body burdens in a representative population of adolescents in Sweden, and to compare results with human biomonitoring guidance values (HBM-GVs). Cluster analyses and Spearman's rank order correlations suggested that concentrations of substances with known common exposure sources and similar toxicokinetics formed obvious clusters and showed moderate to very strong correlations (r ≥ 0.4). No clusters were formed between substances from different matrices. Geometric mean (GM) concentrations of the substances were generally less than 3-fold different from those observed among adolescents in NHANES (USA 2015-16) and GerES V (Germany 2014-17). Notable exceptions were brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) with >20-fold lower GM concentrations, and the biocide triclosan and ultraviolet (UV) filter benzophenone-3 with >15-fold lower mean concentrations in RMA compared to NHANES. Exceedance of the most conservative HBM-GVs were observed for aluminium (Al, 26% of subjects), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS, 19%), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, 12%), lead (Pb, 12%), MBP (dibutyl phthalate metabolite, 4.8%), hexachlorobenzene (HCB, 3.1%) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA, pyrethroid metabolite, 2.2%). Males showed a higher proportion of exceedances than females for Pb, HCB and PFOS; otherwise no gender-related differences in exceedances were observed.

31852531,"Evaluation of the acute toxicity, phototoxicity and embryotoxicity of a residual aqueous fraction from extract of the Antarctic moss Sanionia uncinata.","Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the main exogenous inductor of skin damage and so photoprotection is important to control skin disorders. The Antarctic moss Sanionia uncinata is an important source of antioxidants and the photoprotective activity of its organic extracts has been investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the potential photoprotection, cytotoxicity and embryotoxicity of residual aqueous fraction (AF) from the moss S. uncinata. UV-visible spectrum and SPF (sun protection factor) were determined by spectrophotometry. Embryotoxicity potential was evaluated by Fish embryo-larval toxicity test using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as organism model. Cell death assays by water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were investigated using HaCaT keratinocyte cell line cultured in monolayers and three dimensions (3D). Phototoxicity and association with UV-filters were performed by 3T3 neutral red uptake test. The AF showed sharp absorption bands in the UV region and less pronounced in the visible region. The SPF was low (2.5 ± 0.3), but the SPF values of benzophenone-3 and octyl-methoxycinnamate increased ~ 3 and 4 times more, respectively, in association with AF. The AF did not induce significant lethal and sublethal effects on zebrafish early-life stages. In monolayers, the HaCaT cell viability, evaluated by WST-1, was above 70% by ≤0.4 mg AF/mL after 48 and 72-h exposure, whereas ≤1 mg AF/mL after 24-h exposure. The LDH assay showed that the cell viability was above 70% by ≤0.4 mg AF/mL even after 72-h exposure, but ≤1 mg/mL after 24 and 48-h exposure. In 3D cell culture, an increased cell resistance to toxicity was observed, because cell viability of HaCaT cell by WST-1 and LDH was above ~ 90% when using ≤1 and 4 mg AF/mL, respectively. The AF demonstrated values of photo irritation factor < 2 and of photo effect < 0.1, even though in association with UV-filters. The residual AF absorbs UV-vis spectrum, increased SPF values of BP-3 and OMC and does not induce embryotoxicity to zebrafish early life-stage. The cell death assays allowed establishing non-toxic doses of AF and phototoxicity was not detected. AF of S. uncinata presents a good potential for skin photoprotection against UV-radiation.","da Silva Fernandes Andréia, Brito Lara Barroso, Oliveira Gisele Augusto Rodrigues, Ferraz Elisa Raquel Anastácio, Evangelista Heitor, Mazzei José Luiz, Felzenszwalb Israel",BMC pharmacology & toxicology,2019,"Animals, Antarctic Regions, Bryopsida, Cell Culture Techniques, Cell Line, Cell Survival, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Embryo, Nonmammalian, Humans, Keratinocytes, Plant Extracts, Sun Protection Factor, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays, Zebrafish",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31852531/,"Department of Natural Products, Institute of Drug Technology, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.; Environmental Toxicology Research Laboratory (EnvTox), Faculty of Pharmacy, Federal University of Goiás (UFG), Goiânia, GO, Brazil.; Laboratory of Environmental Mutagenesis, Department of Biophysics and Biometry, University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.; Laboratory of Environmental Mutagenesis, Department of Biophysics and Biometry, University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil. andreiadasilvaf@gmail.com.; Laboratory of Radioecology and Global Changes, Department of Biophysics and Biometry, University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.; Laboratory of Toxicology, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Administration, Pharmacy College, Fluminense Federal University, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil."
30875073,Acute toxicity testing of TiO<sub>2</sub>-based vs. oxybenzone-based sunscreens on clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris).,"Given the prevalence of skin cancer, sunscreens are recommended by dermatologists including the American Academy of Dermatology to protect skin from harmful ultraviolet rays. Unfortunately, this leads to an estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen entering waterways each year. Many of the chemicals in sunscreens, such as oxybenzone and benzophenone-2, are indicated to have adverse effects on corals and other aquatic life. As an eco-conscious alternative, physical barrier sunscreens, such as non-nano-titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), have been suggested as a replacement. This study examines the impact of a non-nano-TiO<sub>2</sub>-based sunscreen over a nationally sold brand of sunscreen containing oxybenzone, on clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris). Animals were evaluated for mortality, swimming behavior, and feeding behavior. Our data indicate that at an exposure level of 100 mg/L oxybenzone-containing sunscreen had a negative impact on mortality, leading to 25% death by the end of the 97-h testing period. Negative impacts on behavior were even more dramatic for the 100 mg/L oxybenzone-containing sunscreen, with 100% of the animals failing to feed over the first 49 h of testing and 100% of animals demonstrating abnormal swimming behavior over the entire testing period. By comparison, the non-nano-(TiO<sub>2</sub>) sunscreen at 100 mg/L had little (6.7%) negative impact on mortality and feeding. While swimming behavior was disrupted during the first 25 h of testing (26.7% abnormal movement), animals recovered well over the remainder of the testing period (out to 97 h).","Barone Alexandra N, Hayes Caitlyn E, Kerr James J, Lee Ryan C, Flaherty Denise B",Environmental science and pollution research international,2019,"Animals, Anthozoa, Benzophenones, Humans, Perciformes, Skin, Sunscreening Agents, Titanium, Toxicity Tests, Acute, Ultraviolet Rays, Water Pollutants, Chemical",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30875073/,"Eckerd College, Collegium of Natural Sciences, St. Petersburg, FL,, USA.; Eckerd College, Collegium of Natural Sciences, St. Petersburg, FL,, USA. flaherdb@eckerd.edu."

Here the metabolic activation mechanism of benzophenone-3 catalyzed by P450 1A1 was investigated by using Molecular Dynamics, Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics and Density Functional Theory approaches. Two elementary reactions involved in the metabolic activation of BP-3 with P450 1A1: electrophilic addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions were both discussed. Further conversion reactions of epoxidation products, ketone products and the formaldehyde formation reaction were investigated in the non-enzymatic environment based on previous experimental reports. Binding affinities analysis of benzophenone-3 and its metabolites to sex hormone binding globulin indirectly demonstrates that they all exhibit endocrine-disrupting property. Toxic analysis shows that the eco-toxicity and bioaccumulation values of the benzophenone-3 metabolites are much lower than those of benzophenone-3. However, the metabolites are found to have skin-sensitization effects. The present study provides a deep insight into the biotransformation process of benzophenone-3 catalyzed by P450 1A1 and alerts us to pay attention to the adverse effects of benzophenone-3 and its metabolites in human livers.","Wang Zijian, Zhang Ruiming, Li Yanwei, Zhang Qingzhu, Wang Wenxing, Wang Qiao",Chemosphere,2024,"Benzophenones, Endocrine Disruptors, Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1, Quantum Theory, Humans, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Catalysis, Biotransformation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38705413/,"College of Ocean Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266237, PR China.; Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao, 266237, PR China.; Environment Research Institute, Shandong University, Qingdao, 266237, PR China.

31339964,"Organic ultraviolet filters in nearshore waters and in the invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans) in Grenada, West Indies.","Sunscreens and other personal care products use organic ultraviolet (UV) filters such as oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate to prevent damage to human skin. While these compounds are effective at preventing sunburn, they have a demonstrated negative effect on cells and tissues across taxonomic levels. These compounds have a relatively short half-life in seawater but are continuously re-introduced via recreational activities and wastewater discharge, making them environmentally persistent. Because of this, testing seawater samples for the presence of these compounds may not be reflective of their abundance in the environment. Bioaccumulation of organic ultraviolet filters in a high-trophic level predator may provide greater insight to the presence and persistence of these compounds. To address this, the present study collected seawater samples as well as muscle and stomach content samples from the invasive Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) in the nearshore waters of Grenada, West Indies to examine the use of lionfish as potential bioindicator species. Seawater and lionfish samples were collected at four sites that are near point sources of wastewater discharge and that receive a high number of visitors each year. Samples were tested for the presence and concentrations of oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Oxybenzone residues were detected in 60% of seawater samples and OMC residues were detected in 20% of seawater samples. Seawater samples collected in the surface waters near Grenada's main beach had oxybenzone concentrations more than ten times higher than seawater samples collected in less frequently visited areas and the highest prevalence of UV filters in lionfish. Residues of oxybenzone were detected in 35% of lionfish muscle and 4-MBC residues were detected in 12% of lionfish muscle. Padimate-O was not detected in either seawater or lionfish samples. No organic UV filters were detected in lionfish stomach contents. Histopathologic examination of lionfish demonstrated no significant findings attributed to UV filter toxicity. These findings report UV filter residue levels for the first time in inshore waters in Grenada. Results indicate that lionfish may be bioaccumulating residues and may be a useful sentinel model for monitoring organic ultraviolet filters in the Caribbean Sea.","Horricks Ryan A, Tabin Sarah K, Edwards Jonnel J, Lumsden John S, Marancik David P",PloS one,2019,"Animals, Benzophenones, Caribbean Region, Environmental Monitoring, Female, Grenada, Humans, Introduced Species, Male, Perciformes, Seawater, Sentinel Species, Sunscreening Agents, Water Pollutants, Chemical",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31339964/,"Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.; Department of Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, St. George's University, True Blue, Grenada, West Indies."

Initially, cyclohexane-1,3-diones were converted to vinylogous thioesters through FeCl<sub>3</sub>-mediated thioenolization. This was followed by LiTMP-mediated acylation and DDQ-mediated aromatization, which resulted in the synthesis of sulphur derived oxybenzone analogs. Notably, replacing the methoxy group of oxybenzone with alkylthioxy or arylthioxy groups significantly enhanced UV absorption properties. The newly synthesized oxybenzone analogs exhibited superior UV absorption, effectively covering the entire UVA and UVB regions spanning from 240 to 440 nm. Furthermore, toxicity studies conducted on HEK293T cells demonstrated that many of the thio-analogs exhibit lower toxicity compared to parent oxybenzone, suggests potential for safer and more effective UV protection formulas.","Keerthana S, Indora Aman, Kumari Shivani, Sadananda Singh Nongmaithem, Goreti Rajendar","Chemistry, an Asian journal",2025,"Humans, Ultraviolet Rays, Benzophenones, HEK293 Cells, Sunscreening Agents, Cell Survival, Sulfhydryl Compounds, Molecular Structure",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39804281/,"School of Biology, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.; School of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, 695551, India."
32497821,Toxic effects and transcriptome analyses of zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae exposed to benzophenones.,"Sunscreen chemicals, such as benzophenones (BPs), are common environmental contaminants that are posing a growing health concern due to their increasing presence in water, fish, and human systems. Benzoresorcinol (BP1), oxybenzone (BP3), and dioxybenzone (BP8) are the most commonly used BPs for their ability to protect from sunburn by absorbing a broad spectrum of ultraviolet radiation. In this study, zebrafish larvae were used as an in vivo model to investigate the potential risks and molecular mechanisms of the toxic effects of BPs. The effects of these BPs on the gene expression in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway, estrogen receptor pathway, and sex differentiation were detected using quantitative real-time PCR. All BPs were found to function as agonists of the estrogen receptors α and β1, indicating that these BPs likely undergo similar molecular metabolism in vivo, whereby they can activate cytochrome P450 genes and promote the expression of CYP19A and DMRT1. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of larvae after BP3 exposure was evaluated using a whole transcriptome sequencing approach. BP3 affected estradiol biosynthesis and sex differentiation. It also regulated gonadotropin-releasing hormone, thus interfering with the endocrine system. As a xenobiotic toxicant, BP3 upregulated the expression of cytochrome P450 genes (CYP1A and CYP3A65) and glutathione metabolism-related genes (GSTA, GSTM, and GSTP). It also interfered with the nervous system by regulating the calcium signaling pathway. These findings will be useful for understanding the toxicity mechanisms and metabolism of BPs in aquatic organisms and promote the regulation of these chemicals in the environment.","Meng Qi, Yeung Karen, Kwok Man Long, Chung Chun Ting, Hu Xue Lei, Chan King Ming","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2020,"Animals, Benzophenones, Gene Expression Profiling, Humans, Larva, Ultraviolet Rays, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Zebrafish",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32497821/,"School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, N.T., Hong Kong.; School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, N.T., Hong Kong.

34523531,Pregnancy exposure to synthetic phenols and placental DNA methylation - An epigenome-wide association study in male infants from the EDEN cohort.,"In utero exposure to environmental chemicals, such as synthetic phenols, may alter DNA methylation in different tissues, including placenta - a critical organ for fetal development. We studied associations between prenatal urinary biomarker concentrations of synthetic phenols and placental DNA methylation. Our study involved 202 mother-son pairs from the French EDEN cohort. Nine phenols were measured in spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks. We performed DNA methylation analysis of the fetal side of placental tissues using the IlluminaHM450 BeadChips. We evaluated methylation changes of individual CpGs in an adjusted epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We performed mediation analysis to test whether placental tissue heterogeneity mediated the association between urinary phenol concentrations and DNA methylation. We identified 46 significant DMRs (≥5 CpGs) associated with triclosan (37 DMRs), 2,4-dichlorophenol (3), benzophenone-3 (3), methyl- (2) and propylparaben (1). All but 2 DMRs were positively associated with phenol concentrations. Out of the 46 identified DMRs, 7 (6 for triclosan) encompassed imprinted genes (APC, FOXG1, GNAS, GNASAS, MIR886, PEG10, SGCE), which represented a significant enrichment. Other identified DMRs encompassed genes encoding proteins responsible for cell signaling, transmembrane transport, cell adhesion, inflammatory, apoptotic and immunological response, genes encoding transcription factors, histones, tumor suppressors, genes involved in tumorigenesis and several cancer risk biomarkers. Mediation analysis suggested that placental cell heterogeneity may partly explain these associations. This is the first study describing the genome-wide modifications of placental DNA methylation associated with pregnancy exposure to synthetic phenols or their precursors. Our results suggest that cell heterogeneity might mediate the effects of triclosan exposure on placental DNA methylation. Additionally, the enrichment of imprinted genes within the DMRs suggests mechanisms by which certain exposures, mainly to triclosan, could affect fetal development.","Jedynak Paulina, Tost Jörg, Calafat Antonia M, Bourova-Flin Ekaterina, Busato Florence, Forhan Anne, Heude Barbara, Jakobi Milan, Rousseaux Sophie, Schwartz Joel, Slama Rémy, Vaiman Daniel, Philippat Claire, Lepeule Johanna","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2021,"DNA Methylation, Epigenome, Female, Histones, Humans, Infant, Male, Phenols, Placenta, Pregnancy",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34523531/,"Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.

39119690,Photoprotection-related properties of a raw extract from <i>Gordonia hongkongensis</i> EUFUS-Z928: A culturable rare actinomycete associated with the Caribbean octocoral <i>Eunicea fusca</i>.,"UV filters in current sunscreen formulations can have negative effects on human health, such as endocrine disruption and allergic reactions, as well as on the environment, including bioaccumulation and coral health toxicity. As a result, there is a need to find alternative compounds that serve as safer and more ecofriendly active ingredients. This study successfully isolated actinomycetes from the octocoral <i>Eunicea fusca</i> and assessed their potential as producers of photoprotective compounds. The use of bio-based chemical agents, particularly natural products, has been a highly effective strategy for discovering bioactive compounds, especially in marine invertebrates and their associated microbiota. Eighteen bacterial isolates were obtained and subsequently employed to prepare raw methanolic extracts from seven-day submerged cultures in Zobell marine broth. The resulting extracts were screened for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging capacity and characterized by total phenolic and flavonoid content measurements. After screening, the <i>Gordonia hongkongensis</i> EUFUS-Z928-derived raw extract exhibited the best antioxidant profile, i.e. DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging of 4.93 and 6.00 µmol Trolox per gram of extract, respectively, and selected for further photoprotection-related analysis. Thus, this extract demonstrated a UV-absorbing capacity of 46.33% of the <i>in vitro</i> sun protection factor calculated for 30 µg/mL oxybenzone but did not exhibit any cytotoxicity on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa cell line) at concentrations up to 500 µg/mL. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry chemical characterization of this extract showed compounds with structural features associated with free radical scavenging and UV absorption (i.e. photoprotection-related activities).

Despite their low toxicity, many research papers indicate that BP-UV filters are weak endocrine disruptors (EDCs). There are clear relationships between BP-UV filters exposure and several health disorders such as carcinogenesis and malformations observed in animals. In the present work, a new sample treatment procedure by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) is proposed for the extraction of six BPs, namely benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-2 (BP-2), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), benzophenone-6 (BP-6), benzophenone-8 (BP-8) and 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OH-BP), in human serum samples, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The method involves an enzymatic treatment to quantify the total content (free plus conjugated species) of BP-UV filters in serum. The extraction parameters were accurately optimized using multivariate optimization approach. Benzophenone-d₁₀ (BP-d₁₀) was used as surrogate. Limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 0.4 to 0.9 ng mL(-1) and inter-day precision (evaluated as relative standard deviation) ranged from 1.9% to 13.1%. The method was validated using matrix-matched calibration and a recovery assay. Recovery rates for spiked samples ranged from 97% to 106%, and acceptable linearity was obtained up to concentrations of 40 ng mL(-1).

15908756,Sunscreen penetration of human skin and related keratinocyte toxicity after topical application.,"Sunscreen skin penetration and safety assessment should be considered together in order to ensure that in vitro cytotoxicity studies examine relevant doses of these organic chemical UV filters to which viable epidermal cells are realistically exposed. In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient topically applied sunscreens penetrated into human viable epidermis to put the local keratinocyte cell populations at risk of toxicity. The penetration and retention of five commonly used sunscreen agents (avobenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, oxybenzone and padimate O) in human skin was evaluated after application in mineral oil to isolated human epidermal membranes. Sunscreen concentration-human keratinocyte culture response curves were then defined using changes in cell morphology and proliferation (DNA synthesis using radiolabelled thymidine uptake studies) as evidence of sunscreens causing toxicity. Following 24 h of human epidermal exposure to sunscreens, detectable amounts of all sunscreens were present in the stratum corneum and viable epidermis, with epidermal penetration most evident with oxybenzone. The concentrations of each sunscreen found in human viable epidermis after topical application, adjusting for skin partitioning and binding effects, were at least 5-fold lower, based on levels detected in viable epidermal cells, than those appearing to cause toxicity in cultured human keratinocytes. It is concluded that the human viable epidermal levels of sunscreens are too low to cause any significant toxicity to the underlying human keratinocytes.","Hayden C G J, Cross S E, Anderson C, Saunders N A, Roberts M S",Skin pharmacology and physiology,2005,"Cells, Cultured, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Humans, Keratinocytes, Skin, Skin Absorption, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15908756/,"Therapeutics Research Unit, University of Queensland, Southern Clinical School, University of Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia."

The case study uses a theoretical scenario where there are no systemic toxicity data for the case study chemicals (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, octinoxate, and ecamsule). Human dermal pharmacokinetic data following single and repeat dermal exposure to products containing the case study chemicals were obtained from data published by the US FDA. The clinical studies utilized an application procedure that followed maximal use conditions (product applied as 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 75% of the body surface area, 4 times a day). The case study chemicals were first reviewed to determine if they were in the applicability domain of the iTTC, and then, the human plasma concentrations were compared to an iTTC limit of 1 µM. When assessed under maximum usage, the external exposure of all chemicals exceeded the external dose TTC limits. By contrast, the internal exposure to all chemicals, except oxybenzone, was an order of magnitude lower than the 1 µM interim iTTC threshold. This work highlights the importance of understanding internal exposure relative to external dose and how the iTTC can be a valuable tool for assessing low-level internal exposures; additionally, the work demonstrates how to use an iTTC, and highlights considerations and refinement opportunities for the approach.","Najjar Abdulkarim, Ellison Corie A, Gregoire Sebastien, Hewitt Nicola J",Archives of toxicology,2023,"Humans, Benzophenones, Risk Assessment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36149470/,"Beiersdorf AG, Unnastrasse 48, 20245, Hamburg, Germany.; Cosmetics Europe, Avenue Herrmann-Debroux 40, 1160, Brussels, Belgium.; L'Oreal Research & Innovation, 1, Avenue Eugène Schueller, 93601, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France.; The Procter & Gamble Company, 8700 Mason Montgomery Road, Cincinnati, OH, 45040, USA.

26048057,A novel two-dimensional liquid-chromatography method for online prediction of the toxicity of transformation products of benzophenones after water chlorination.,"Benzophenone-type UV filters (BPs) are ubiquitous in the environment. Transformation products (TPs) of BPs with suspected toxicity are likely to be produced during disinfection of water by chlorination. To quickly predict the toxicity of TPs, in this study, a novel two-dimensional liquid-chromatography (2D-LC) method was established in which the objective of the first dimension was to separate the multiple components of the BPs sample after chlorination, using a reversed-phase liquid-chromatography mode. A biochromatographic system, i.e. bio-partitioning micellar chromatography with the polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether aqueous solution as the mobile phase, served as the second dimension to predict the toxicity of the fraction from the first dimension on the basis of the quantitative retention-activity relationships (QRARs) model. Six BPs, namely 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone, oxybenzone, 4-hydroxybenzophenone, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonic acid, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone and 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, were the target analytes subjected to chlorination. The products of these BPs after chlorination were directly injected to the 2D-LC system for analysis. The results indicated that most TPs may be less toxic than their parent chemicals, but some may be more toxic, and that intestinal toxicity of TPs may be more obvious than blood toxicity. The proposed method is time-saving, high-throughput, and reliable, and has great potential for predicting toxicity or bioactivity of unknown and/or known components in a complex sample.
