15379874,Prevention of ultraviolet-induced skin pigmentation.,"Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation increases skin pigmentation and usually results in an even darkening of the skin. However, it may also occasionally lead to the development of hyperpigmented lesions due to a local overproduction of pigment. Skin pigmentation is induced both by UVB and UVA rays. The in vivo protection by sunscreens against pigmentation was studied using the determination of a level of protection against pigmentation based on the standardized sun protection factor (SPF) test method. The method includes delayed UVB and UVA pigmentations. The level of prevention against pigmentation was determined 7 days after exposure to solar-simulated radiation by visual assessment. It was calculated using the ratio of the minimal pigmenting dose on protected skin to the minimal pigmenting dose on unprotected skin. Broadspectrum UVB/UVA filters, Mexoryl SX and Mexoryl XL, and complete formula were tested. Protection against pigmentation correlates with the concentration of Mexoryl SX. The levels of protection obtained show a synergetic effect of Mexoryl SX when associated with Mexoryl XL. When different products having the same SPF (same protection against erythema) and different levels of UVA protection are compared, only sunscreen products with a high level of UVA protection show a similar level of protection against sunburn and pigmentation. Products with low UVA protection have a lower capacity of preventing induced pigmentation compared with their efficacy against erythema. These studies have evidenced that SPF determination was not sufficient to account for the efficiency in preventing pigmentation and that UVA protection was an essential part of this prevention.",Moyal Dominique,"Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine",2004,"Adolescent, Adult, Camphanes, Camphor, Drug Synergism, Erythema, Humans, Mesylates, Middle Aged, Radiation Dosage, Skin Pigmentation, Sulfonic Acids, Sunburn, Sunlight, Sunscreening Agents, Time Factors, Triazoles, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15379874/,"L'Oréal Recherche, 8/12 Impasse Barbier, 92117 Clichy, France. dmoyal@rd.loreal.com"
20494856,Vitamin D levels of XP-patients under stringent sun-protection.,"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an increased skin cancer risk due to defective repair of ultraviolet (UV)-radiation induced DNA damage. Therefore patients with XP are required to apply stringent sun-protection. Since the skin needs UV-B irradiation for de novo vitamin D synthesis, it has been postulated that sun-protection may lead to a clinically relevant reduction of vitamin D levels. To investigate whether reduced vitamin D levels in XP-patients are caused by the stringent sun-protection measures employed, in this study we examined 15 patients with XP. The 25-hydroxyvitamin (25-OHD) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D) serum levels were measured. Additionally, patients received a questionnaire about their sun-protection-behaviour. Serum levels for 25-OHD were decreased in 10 of 15 (67%) patients, however there was no statistically significant association between decreased 25-OHD serum levels and duration of sun-protection (p = 0.84). Results for 1,25-(OH)2D levels showed a probability of < 0.16 and between 0.16 and 0.77 for sun-protection duration of < 20 and 20 to 40 years, respectively (p = 0.0058). There was no statistically significant association between the duration of sun-protection with drometrizole trisiloxane and the probability of reduced 25-OHD and 1,25-(OH)2D levels. In conclusion, this investigation indicates that vitamin D serum levels in patients with XP may be normal, increased or decreased but this is not causally linked to the stringent photoprotective measures carried out in our group of investigated XP-patients.","Hoesl Mirka, Dietz Klaus, Röcken Martin, Berneburg Mark",European journal of dermatology : EJD,2010,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Protective Clothing, Retrospective Studies, Sunlight, Sunscreening Agents, Surveys and Questionnaires, Vitamin D, Vitamin D Deficiency, Xeroderma Pigmentosum",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20494856/,"Department of Dermatology, Eberhard Karls University, Liebermeisterstrasse 25, D-72076 Tübingen, Germany."
