27561611,Advanced UV Absorbers for the Protection of Human Skin.,"The increasing awareness of the damaging effects of UV radiation to human skin triggered the market introduction of new cosmetic UV absorbers. This article summarizes the outcome of a multi-year research program, in which the author contributed to the development of different new UV filters. First of all, the molecular design and the basic properties of bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (BEMT) will be presented. This oil-soluble filter, which today is widely used in both beach products and skin care products, exhibits inherent photostability and strong broad-spectrum UV-A+B absorbance. Based on the concept of micronized organic UV absorbers, the UV-B filter tris biphenyl triazine (TBPT) will be introduced. At present TBPT exhibits the highest efficacy of all cosmetic UV absorbers in the market (measured by area under the UV spectrum). Finally, the concept of liposomogenic UV absorbers will be featured. This approach was developed to create water-resistant UV filters, as liposomogenic structures are thought to integrate into the lipids of the horny layer. Due to prohibitively high costs, this technology did not result in a commercial product so far.",Hüglin Dietmar,Chimia,2016,"Cosmetics, Humans, Phenols, Radiation-Protective Agents, Skin Aging, Triazines, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27561611/,"BASF Schweiz AG Klybeckstrasse 141, CH-4057 Basel, Switzerland. dietmar.hueglin@basf.com."
11594052,"Photostabilization of butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone) and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate by bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), a new UV broadband filter.","It is now well documented that chronic UVA exposure induces damage to human skin. Therefore, modern sunscreens should not only provide protection from both UVB and UVA radiation but also maintain this protection during the entire period of exposure to the sun. UVA filters, however, are rare and not sufficiently photostable. We investigated the effect of the introduction of a new UV filter, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), in oil in water sunscreen formulations on the photostability of butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone [AVB]) after irradiation with an optically filtered Xenon arc source (UV irradiance adjusted at 1 mean effective dose [MED]/min). With spectrophotometrical methods to assess the sun protection factor (SPF) and UVA ratio and chromatographical methods to determine the amount of UV filters recovered after irradiation we showed that Tinosorb S prevented the photodegradation of AVB in a concentration-dependent way, leading to a sustained SPF and UVA ratio even after irradiation with doses of up to 30 MED. Since AVB was shown to destabilize ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHM) we tested the effect of Tinosorb S in sunscreens containing this UV filter combination. Here too Tinosorb S showed photoprotective properties toward both UV filters. Thus, Tinosorb S can be used successfully to improve the photostability and efficiency of sunscreens containing AVB and EHM.","Chatelain E, Gabard B",Photochemistry and photobiology,2001,"Benzoates, Chalcones, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Cinnamates, Drug Stability, Humans, In Vitro Techniques, Phenols, Photochemistry, Propiophenones, Skin, Sunscreening Agents, Triazines, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11594052/,"Department of Biopharmacy, Spirig Pharma Ltd, CH-4622 Egerkingen, Switzerland. eric.chatelain@spirig.ch"
25533240,Combination of retinyl palmitate and UV-filters: phototoxic risk assessment based on photostability and in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity assays.,"This study aimed to assess the phototoxic potential of combined UV-filters and retinyl palmitate (RP) in the presence or not of bemotrizinol (BMTZ), employing photostability and in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity assays. The formulations tested contained octocrylene (OCT), octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), benzophenone-3 (BZP-3) and RP (photostable) or octocrylene (OCT), octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), avobenzone (AVO) and RP (less photostable). Both formulations were supplemented with bemotrizinol. Photostability was evaluated by exposing, or not, formulations spread on a glass plate to UVA/UVB irradiation. The resulting products were quantified by HPLC analysis. In vitro phototoxicity of UV-filters and combinations were evaluated using 3T3 viable monolayer fibroblast cultures submitted, or not, to irradiation according to OECD TG 432. In vivo photoallergy and photoxicity were assessed by clinical studies (photopatch test). Photostability assays showed that UV-filter bemotrizinol was a better photostabilizer for RP/benzophenone-3 than for RP/avobenzone. The in vitro phototoxicity of the combination RP/avobenzone was reduced by bemotrizinol. Clinical studies did not indicate phototoxic or photoallergenic potentials in all formulations tested. It is concluded that the 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test may be considered a supplementary assay in formulation developments, since it can detect chemically unstable and potentially phototoxic combinations. However, extrapolation of in vitro positive results to human photopatch tests may be performed only to a limited extent.","Benevenuto Carolina Gomes, Guerra Lucas Offenbecker, Gaspar Lorena Rigo",European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2015,"3T3 Cells, Acrylates, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Animals, Benzophenones, Cinnamates, Dermatitis, Photoallergic, Dermatitis, Phototoxic, Diterpenes, Double-Blind Method, Drug Interactions, Drug Stability, Humans, Mice, Middle Aged, Neutral Red, Phenols, Retinyl Esters, Risk Assessment, Sunscreening Agents, Triazines, Ultraviolet Rays, Vitamin A, Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25533240/,"Allergisa - Investiga Research Institute, Barao Geraldo, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

24157543,"Evaluation of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and nanoemulsions as carriers for UV-filters: characterization, in vitro penetration and photostability studies.","The increased awareness of protection against UV radiation damages has led to a rise in the use of topically applied chemical sunscreen agents and to an increased need of innovative carriers designed to achieve the highest protective effect and reduce the toxicological risk resulting from the percutaneous absorption of these substances. In this paper, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and nanoemulsions (NE) were formulated to optimize the topical application of different and widespread UVA or UVB sun filters (ethyl hexyltriazone (EHT), diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (DHHB), bemotrizinol (Tinosorb S), octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC) and avobenzone (AVO)). The preparation and stability parameters of these nanocarriers have been investigated concerning particle size and zeta potential. The release pattern of the sunscreens from NLC and NE was evaluated in vitro, determining their percutaneous absorption through excised human skin. Additional in vitro studies were performed in order to evaluate, after UVA radiation treatment, the spectral stability of the sunfilters once formulated in NLC or NE. From the results obtained, when incorporated in NLC, the skin permeation abilities of the sun filter were drastically reduced, remaining mainly on the surface of the skin. The photostability studies showed that EHT, DHHB and Tinosorb S still retain their photostability when incorporated in these carriers, while OMC and AVO were not photostable as expected. However, no significant differences in terms of photoprotective efficacy between the two carriers were observed.","Puglia Carmelo, Damiani Elisabetta, Offerta Alessia, Rizza Luisa, Tirendi Giorgia Giusy, Tarico Maria Stella, Curreri Sergio, Bonina Francesco, Perrotta Rosario Emanuele",European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2014,"Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug Carriers, Drug Stability, Humans, Lipids, Nanostructures, Particle Size, Permeability, Skin, Skin Absorption, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24157543/,"Dipartimento di Scienze del Farmaco, Università di Catania, 95125 Catania, Italy.

19002338,Prevention of polymorphic light eruption with a sunscreen of very high protection level against UVB and UVA radiation under standardized photodiagnostic conditions.,"Polymorphic light eruption (PLE), with an overall prevalence of 10-20%, is mainly provoked by ultraviolet A (UVA) (320-400 nm) and to a lesser degree by UVB (280-320 nm). The most effective prophylaxis of PLE, application of UV protection clothing, is not feasible for all sun-exposed areas of the skin and UV-hardening is time-consuming and may be associated with side-effects. Most sunscreens protect predominantly against UVB and therefore fail to prevent PLE. The protection level of potent UVA-protective filters remains unresolved. This single-centre, open, placebo-controlled, intra-individual, comparative study, analysed the efficacy of a sunscreen of very high protection level against UVB and UVA, containing methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M), bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S) and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane as UVA absorbing filters, in the prevention of PLE under standardized photodiagnostic conditions. After determination of the minimal erythema dose at day 0, photoprovocation was performed in 12 patients with a clinical history of PLE, on days 1, 2 and 3 with 100 J/cm2 UVA and variable doses of UVB, starting with the 1.5-fold minimal erythema dose of UVB. Prior to irradiation, placebo was applied to the right and sunscreen to the left dorsal forearm under COLIPA (European Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association) conditions. In 10 patients PLE could be provoked at the placebo site, with positive reactions in 90% of the UVA, 40% of the UVB and 90% of the UVA/UVB irradiated fields. At the site with the active treatment none of these patients developed PLE. These data demonstrate that a sunscreen with effective filters against UVA and UVB can successfully prevent the development of PLE. Further studies are needed to examine whether regular application of sunscreen under everyday conditions, especially in doses less than the tested COLIPA-norm, could be an equivalent alternative to UV-hardening therapy.","Schleyer Verena, Weber Oliver, Yazdi Amir, Benedix Frauke, Dietz Klaus, Röcken Martin, Berneburg Mark",Acta dermato-venereologica,2008,"Alkanes, Chalcones, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Phenols, Photosensitivity Disorders, Propiophenones, Sunscreening Agents, Triazines, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19002338/,"Dermatology Clinic, Augsburg, Germany."
15099187,Revolutionary advances in sun-protective clothing--an essential step in eliminating skin cancer in our world.,"For many years, individuals around the world have relied on sunscreen alone as their primary form of protection against ultraviolet rays (UV-R). Australia has shown that a multitactic approach to skin cancer prevention, combining sun-protective clothing with sunscreen, can be both highly effective and widely accepted by the general public. In the US, the aging baby boomer generation and rising skin cancer epidemic call for a fundamental behavioral shift toward this combination approach to sun protection. Sun-protective clothing, such as that manufactured by Coolibar and awarded the Seal of Recommendation by The Skin Cancer Foundation, offers millions of Americans the opportunity to significantly improve the quality of their lives and is an essential step in eliminating skin cancer in our world. All Coolibar clothing products carry a minimum ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) rating of 30, blocking 97% UV-R or greater. Each product in the Coolibar clothing line is individually tested and rated for its UV protection level; this process is explained in a thorough hangtag attached to the product. This tag specifies what UPF the product has received, how the UPF is figured, which testing procedures the individual product was submitted to, and if that product has received the Seal of Recommendation from The Skin Cancer Foundation. In addition to photoprotective clothing, The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends Rit Sun Guard, a photoprotective laundry additive. Rit Sun Guard washes into the clothing fibers and absorbs broadband UV-R. A single treatment of Rit Sun Guard sustains a UPF of 30 for approximately 20 launderings. The active ingredient in Rit Sun Guard is TINOSORB FD. In order to be certified by The Skin Cancer Foundation, the Coolibar clothing product must undergo extensive UPF testing to confirm the accuracy of the product labeling. Laundry additives evaluated by The Skin Cancer Foundation undergo similar tests to that of photoprotective clothing after a uniform laundering method is used to apply the product to the clothing fibers. Both of these certification processes confirm the UPF, UV-A and UV-B transmittance, and percentage blocking UV-A and UV-B. The certification process is reviewed on an annual basis.","Edlich Richard F, Cox Mary Jude, Becker Daniel G, Horowitz Jed H, Nichter Larry S, Britt L D, Lineaweaver William C, Edlich Theodore J, Long William B",Journal of long-term effects of medical implants,2004,"Health Promotion, Humans, Protective Clothing, Skin Neoplasms, Sunburn",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15099187/,"University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA."
