37758070,Single and mixture toxicity evaluation of avobenzone and homosalate to male zebrafish and H295R cells.,"Avobenzone and homosalate are widely used in sunscreens to provide ultraviolet (UV) protection, either as single compounds or in combination. Some UV filters exhibit estrogenic or anti-androgenic activities, however, studies regarding their interactions and toxicity in mixtures are limited. In this study, the effect of the toxicity of a binary mixture comprising avobenzone (0.72 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) and homosalate (1.02 and 103 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) on steroid hormone biosynthesis were investigated using male zebrafish and human adrenocortical carcinoma (H295R) cells. In fish exposed to homosalate, a significant decrease in the gonadosomatic index, testosterone level, and transcription of several genes (e.g, hsd3b2, cyp17a1, and hsd17b1) and a significant increase in the hepatosomatic index, liver steatosis, 17β-estradiol level, and transcription of vtg gene were observed. These results suggest that estrogenic and anti-androgenic effects of homosalate were mediated by the steroidogenic pathway. The presence of 0.72 μg L<sup>-1</sup> of avobenzone augmented the anti-androgenic responses in male fish. The testosterone level in the H295R cells were significantly decreased after they were exposed to homosalate alone or in combination with avobenzone, which is consistent with observations in male zebrafish. Further studies need to be conducted to understand the endocrine disrupting properties of long-term exposure to substances typically used in sunscreens.","Lee Sujin, Ka Yujin, Lee Bomi, Lee Inhye, Seo Ye Eun, Shin Hyewon, Kho Younglim, Ji Kyunghee",Chemosphere,2023,"Animals, Male, Humans, Zebrafish, Sunscreening Agents, Estrone, Androgen Antagonists, Testosterone, Endocrine Disruptors, Water Pollutants, Chemical",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37758070/,"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea.; Department of Environmental Health, Graduate School at Yongin University, Yongin, Gyeonggi, 17092, Republic of Korea.; Department of Environmental Health, Graduate School at Yongin University, Yongin, Gyeonggi, 17092, Republic of Korea.

22612478,Sunscreens: are they beneficial for health? An overview of endocrine disrupting properties of UV-filters.,"Today, topical application of sunscreens, containing ultraviolet-filters (UV-filters), is preferred protection against adverse effects of ultraviolet radiation. Evidently, use of sunscreens is effective in prevention of sunburns in various models. However, evidence for their protective effects against melanoma skin cancer is less conclusive. Three important observations prompted us to review the animal data and human studies on possible side effects of selected chemical UV-filters in cosmetics. (1) the utilization of sunscreens with UV-filters is increasing worldwide; (2) the incidence of the malignant disorder for which sunscreens should protect, malignant melanoma, is rapidly increasing and (3) an increasing number of experimental studies indicating that several UV-filters might have endocrine disruptive effects. The selected UV-filters we review in this article are benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 3-benzylidene camphor (3-BC), 3-(4-methyl-benzylidene) camphor (4-MBC), 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxy cinnamate (OMC), Homosalate (HMS), 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (OD-PABA) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). The potential adverse effects induced by UV-filters in experimental animals include reproductive/developmental toxicity and disturbance of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT). Few human studies have investigated potential side effects of UV-filters, although human exposure is high as UV-filters in sunscreens are rapidly absorbed from the skin. One of the UV-filters, BP-3, has been found in 96% of urine samples in the US and several UV-filters in 85% of Swiss breast milk samples. It seems pertinent to evaluate whether exposure to UV-filters contribute to possible adverse effects on the developing organs of foetuses and children.","Krause M, Klit A, Blomberg Jensen M, Søeborg T, Frederiksen H, Schlumpf M, Lichtensteiger W, Skakkebaek N E, Drzewiecki K T",International journal of andrology,2012,"4-Aminobenzoic Acid, Animals, Benzyl Compounds, Camphor, Cinnamates, Endocrine Disruptors, Humans, Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System, Melanoma, Receptors, Estrogen, Salicylates, Skin Neoplasms, Sunburn, Sunscreening Agents, Thyroid Gland, Ultraviolet Rays, para-Aminobenzoates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22612478/,"Department of Growth and Reproduction, University of Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark."
37647541,"Concentrations, Profiles, and Health Risks of Organic Ultraviolet Filters in Eight Food Categories Determined through the Sixth Chinese Total Diet Study.","Ultraviolet (UV) filters are emerging contaminants that have been found in high concentrations in human tissues. Food intake is generally considered to be the primary route of human exposure to contaminants. In this study, 184 composite food samples, prepared from 4268 individual samples in eight categories collected from 23 Chinese provinces for the sixth Chinese total diet study, were analyzed. The total and median UV filter concentrations in food samples were 1.5-68.3 and 7.9 ng/g wet weight, respectively. The highest median concentrations were found in decreasing order in meat, cereals, and legumes. In total, 15 UV filters were analyzed. 2-Ethylhexyl salicylate, homosalate, and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate were dominant and made median contributions of 34.1%, 22.6%, and 14.5%, respectively, and 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-di-<i>tert</i>-pentylphenol contributed the median of 0.03%, of the total UV filter concentrations. The estimated total daily UV filter intake in animal-origin foods and total UV filter concentration in human milk from the same province were significantly correlated (r = 0.44, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Predicted absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination properties led to 10 UV filters being prioritized as most likely to be retained in human tissues. The prioritization results and toxicity assessments indicated that octocrylene and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate have stronger effects in vivo and therefore require more attention than others.","Liu Yang, Gao Lirong, Ai Qiaofeng, Qiao Lin, Li Jingguang, Lyu Bing, Zheng Minghui, Wu Yongning",Environmental science & technology,2023,"Animals, Humans, Food, Cinnamates, Fabaceae, Diet",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37647541/,"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China.; Research Unit of Food Safety, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (No. 2019RU014); NHC Key Lab of Food Safety Risk Assessment, China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment (CFSA), Beijing 100022, China.; State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."
37561120,Comparison between endocrine activity assessed using ToxCast/Tox21 database and human plasma concentration of sunscreen active ingredients/UV filters.,"Sunscreen products are composed of ultraviolet (UV) filters and formulated to reduce exposure to sunlight thereby lessening skin damage. Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity and potential endocrine disrupting (ED) effects of UV filters. The ToxCast/Tox21 program, that is, CompTox, is a high-throughput in vitro screening database of chemicals that identify adverse outcome pathways, key events, and ED potential of chemicals. Using the ToxCast/Tox21 database, octisalate, homosalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and avobenzone, 6 commonly used organic UV filters, were found to have been evaluated. These UV filters showed low potency in these bioassays with most activity detected above the range of the cytotoxic burst. The pathways that were most affected were the cell cycle and the nuclear receptor pathways. Most activity was observed in liver and kidney-based bioassays. These organic filters and their metabolites showed relatively weak ED activity when tested in bioassays measuring estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), thyroid receptor, and steroidogenesis activity. Except for oxybenzone, all activity in the endocrine assays occurred at concentrations greater than the cytotoxic burst. Moreover, except for oxybenzone, plasma concentrations (Cmax) measured in humans were at least 100× lower than bioactive (AC50/ACC) concentrations that produced a response in ToxCast/Tox21 assays. These data are consistent with in vivo animal/human studies showing weak or negligible endocrine activity. In sum, when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence assessment and compared with measured plasma concentrations, the results show these organic UV filters have low intrinsic biological activity and risk of toxicity including endocrine disruption in humans.","Onyango David O, Selman Bastian G, Rose Jane L, Ellison Corie A, Nash J F",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,2023,"Animals, Humans, Sunscreening Agents, Benzophenones, Receptors, Estrogen",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37561120/,"Global Product Stewardship, The Procter & Gamble Company, Mason, Ohio 45040, USA."
25128891,Interaction mechanisms between organic UV filters and bovine serum albumin as determined by comprehensive spectroscopy exploration and molecular docking.,"Organic UV filters are a group of emerging PPCP (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) contaminants. Current information is insufficient to understand the in vivo processes and health risks of organic UV filters in humans. The interaction mechanism of UV filters with serum albumin provides critical information for the health risk assessment of these active ingredients in sunscreen products. This study investigates the interaction mechanisms of five commonly used UV filters (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, BP-3; 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate, EHMC; 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, 4-MBC; methoxydibenzoylmethane, BDM; homosalate, HMS) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) by spectroscopic measurements of fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), competitive binding experiments and molecular docking. Our results indicated that the fluorescence of BSA was quenched by these UV filters through a static quenching mechanism. The values of the binding constant (Ka) ranged from (0.78±0.02)×10(3) to (1.29±0.01)×10(5) L mol(-1). Further exploration by synchronous fluorescence and CD showed that the conformation of BSA was demonstrably changed in the presence of these organic UV filters. It was confirmed that the UV filters can disrupt the α-helical stability of BSA. Moreover, the results of molecular docking revealed that the UV filter molecule is located in site II (sub-domain IIIA) of BSA, which was further confirmed by the results of competitive binding experiments. In addition, binding occurred mainly through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. This study raises critical concerns regarding the transportation, distribution and toxicity effects of organic UV filters in human body.","Ao Junjie, Gao Li, Yuan Tao, Jiang Gaofeng",Chemosphere,2015,"Animals, Binding, Competitive, Cattle, Circular Dichroism, Humans, Hydrogen Bonding, Molecular Docking Simulation, Protein Binding, Protein Conformation, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Sunscreening Agents, Thermodynamics",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25128891/,"School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.; School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.

40208192,Mode of action approach supports a lack of carcinogenic potential of six organic UV filters.,"Ultraviolet (UV) filters, the active ingredients in sunscreens, have been used for several decades to reduce the risk of acute and chronic damage to the skin from solar UV radiation, which can lead to skin cancer. Based on recent clinical studies showing that certain UV filters are absorbed systemically at low levels in humans, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested supplementing existing safety data with preclinical studies including oral and dermal 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies. Although the conduct of 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies has been the standard approach for evaluating the carcinogenic potential of chemicals and new drugs for approximately 6 decades, there are multiple examples showing that such studies are not predictive of human cancer risk. Given these concerns with 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies, we have developed and applied an alternative approach for supplementing existing data related to carcinogenic potential for six of the most commonly used UV filters in sunscreen products (i.e. avobenzone, ensulizole, homosalate, octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene). This approach evaluates their mode of action (MOA) based on <i>in vivo</i>, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in silico</i> data combined with an assessment of exposure margins. This approach is based on the substantial progress in understanding the MOAs that are responsible for tumor induction in humans. It is consistent with those being developed by the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and other health authorities to replace 2-year carcinogenicity studies given their limitations and questionable biological relevance to humans. The available data for the six UV filters show that they are not genotoxic and show no evidence of biologically relevant carcinogenic MOAs. Furthermore, their systemic exposure levels in humans fall well below concentrations at which they have biologic activity. In conclusion, these data support the continued safe use of these six filters in sunscreen products.","Cohen Samuel M, Boobis Alan R, Jacobson-Kram David, Schoeny Rita, Rosol Thomas J, Williams Gary M, Kaminski Norbert E, Eichenbaum Gary M, Guengerich F Peter, Nash J F",Critical reviews in toxicology,2025,"Ultraviolet Rays, Sunscreening Agents, Animals, Mice, Rats, Humans, Carcinogenicity Tests, Carcinogens, Propiophenones, Benzimidazoles, Sulfonic Acids, Salicylates, Cinnamates, Acrylates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40208192/,"Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; Histology Core Facility and Biomedical Sciences, Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA.; National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Oaktree Life Sciences Consulting, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.; Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.; Procter & Gamble, Mason, OH, USA.; Rita Schoeny, LLC, Washington, DC, USA.; ToxRox Consulting, LLC, Bethesda, MD, USA."
29604311,Encapsulation and controlled release of retinol from silicone particles for topical delivery.,"Retinol, a derivative of vitamin A, is a ubiquitous compound used to treat acne, reduce wrinkles and protect against conditions like psoriasis and ichthyosis. While retinol is used as the primary active ingredient (AI) in many skin care formulations, its efficacy is often limited by an extreme sensitivity to degrade and toxicity at high concentrations. While microencapsulation is an appealing method to help overcome these issues, few microencapsulation strategies have made a major translational impact due to challenges with complexity, cost, limited protection of the AI and poor control of the release of the AI. We have developed a class of silicone particles that addresses these challenges for the encapsulation, protection and controlled release of retinol and other hydrophobic compounds. The particles are prepared by the sol-gel polymerization of silane monomers, which enables their rapid and facile synthesis at scale while maintaining a narrow size distribution (i.e., CV < 20%). We show that our particles can: (i) encapsulate retinol with high efficiency (>85%), (ii) protect retinol from degradation (yielding a half-life 9× greater than unencapsulated retinol) and (iii) slowly release retinol over several hours (at rates from 0.14 to 0.67 μg cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1/2</sup>). To demonstrate that the controlled release of retinol from the particles can reduce irritation, we performed a double blind study on human subjects and found that formulations containing our particles were 12-23% less irritating than identical formulations containing Microsponge® particles (an industry standard by Amcol, Inc.). To show that the silicone particles can elicit a favorable biological response, similar to the Microsponge® particles, we applied both formulations to reconstructed human epidermal tissues and found an upregulation of keratin 19 (K19) and a downregulation of K10, indicating that the reduced irritation observed in the human study was not caused by reduced activity. We also found a decrease in the production of interleukin-1α (IL-1α) compared to formulations containing the Microsponge particles, suggesting lower irritation levels and supporting the findings from the human study. Finally, we show that the silicone particles can encapsulate other AIs, including betamethasone, N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), homosalate and ingenol mebutate, establishing these particles as a true platform technology.","Shields C Wyatt, White John P, Osta Erica G, Patel Jerishma, Rajkumar Shashank, Kirby Nickolas, Therrien Jean-Philippe, Zauscher Stefan",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2018,"Administration, Cutaneous, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Delayed-Action Preparations, Dermatologic Agents, Double-Blind Method, Down-Regulation, Drug Carriers, Drug Compounding, Drug Delivery Systems, Female, Humans, Keratin-10, Keratin-19, Male, Silicones, Skin, Skin Irritancy Tests, Up-Regulation, Vitamin A",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29604311/,"Department of Skin Biology, EnDev Laboratories, Kannapolis, NC 28081, USA.; NSF Research Triangle Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA.; NSF Research Triangle Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA; Department of Chemistry, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA.; NSF Research Triangle Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA.

39709705,A novel approach for unveiling co-occurrence patterns of UV filter mixtures in sunscreens: Prioritization for hazard and risk assessment.,"In recent years, concerns regarding the toxicity of organic UV filters in sunscreen products have increased. While sunscreen products contain multiple UV filters in combination, current understanding on their co-occurrence patterns and mixture toxicities is still limited. This study utilized a public database, ""Hwahae"", and analyzed 2183 sunscreen products marketed in South Korea as of 2019, using an association rule mining (ARM) to elucidate their co-occurrence patterns. We identified twenty-two UV filters in the sunscreen products, with titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) being the most prevalent (68 %), followed by ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC, 60 %) and ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS, 49 %). Sunscreen products typically contained a median of five UV filters per product. Usage patterns of UV filter mixtures varied by the target user group of the product, i.e., general, susceptible, and male users. EHMC and EHS were commonly combined in most products, except those marketed for susceptible users. For susceptible users, inorganic UV filters such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and zinc oxide (ZnO) were dominantly used. Combinations of UV filters that provide protection against different types of UV light, e.g., butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM) for UVA, and octocrylene (OCT), EHS, or homosalate (HS) for UVB, were also frequently used together, with high lift values. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that ARM approach can be useful to identify major combinations of UV filters present in sunscreen products, and prioritize the UV filter combinations requiring safety assessment and regulatory attention.","Jo Ah-Reum, Kwon Ba Reum, Lee Inae, Min Jieun, Choi Sohyeon, Park Na-Youn, Kho Younglim, Park Jeongim, Kim Ho, Choi Kyungho",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2025,"Sunscreening Agents, Republic of Korea, Risk Assessment, Ultraviolet Rays, Humans, Titanium, Cinnamates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39709705/,"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, Soonchunhyang University, Asan, South Korea.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.

34426877,"Emerging contaminants and priority substances in marine sediments from Cartagena Bay and the Grand Marsh of Santa Marta (Ramsar site), Colombia.","Emerging pollutants and priority substances are of growing concern due to their toxicity potential to aquatic organisms and human health. However, few reports on this issue in marine ecosystems in general and, more specifically, on the Colombian Caribbean coast are available. The aim of this study was to detect these compounds in sediments from Cartagena Bay (CB) and in the Grand Marsh of Santa Marta, GMSM (Ramsar site), in order to determine how they related to in vitro cytotoxicity assays on HepG2 cells of sediment extracts. A total of thirty compounds were detected using GC-MS/MS in fifteen stations during both the rainy and the dry seasons. Sediments from CB had a wide range of different toxicants, with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) being the most prevalent (12 PAHs, 5.5-881.6 ng/g). Total PCBs ranged from < LOD to 18.6 ng/g, with PCB 138 being the most common detected congener. Residues of p,p'-DDE, Chlorpyrifos and two organophosphate flame retardants, TEHP and ToTP, were found in most sampling locations. The UV filters 4MBC and homosalate were recurrently found in sediments, and the fragrance galaxolide appeared in all cases, with the greatest concentrations found on a touristic beach. In GMSM, with the exception of deltamethrin, all chemicals evaluated had lower average values than in CB. According to sediment quality guidelines, some sites in CB presented values of PAHs higher than the threshold effects level, while in the marsh, none of the stations exceeded it. HepG2 cells exposed to 1% sediment extracts presented reduced cell viability up to 26%. Cytotoxicity displayed a negative correlation with chlorpyrifos concentration. In short, these data suggest the bay and the marsh have specific contamination fingerprints related to anthropogenic interventions. This research highlights the need to further investigate the ecotoxicological implications of detected chemical stressors in these ecosystems.","Caballero-Gallardo Karina, Olivero-Verbel Jesus, Corada-Fernández Carmen, Lara-Martín Pablo A, Juan-García Ana",Environmental monitoring and assessment,2021,"Bays, Colombia, Ecosystem, Environmental Monitoring, Geologic Sediments, Humans, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Wetlands",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34426877/,"Campus of International Excellence of the Sea (CEI·MAR), Marine Research Institute (INMAR), University of Cadiz, 11510, Cadiz, Spain.; Environmental and Computational Chemistry Group.

36149470,Practical application of the interim internal threshold of toxicological concern (iTTC): a case study based on clinical data.,"We present a case study that provides a practical step-by-step example of how the internal Threshold of Toxicological Concern (iTTC) can be used as a tool to refine a TTC-based assessment for dermal exposures to consumer products. The case study uses a theoretical scenario where there are no systemic toxicity data for the case study chemicals (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, octinoxate, and ecamsule). Human dermal pharmacokinetic data following single and repeat dermal exposure to products containing the case study chemicals were obtained from data published by the US FDA. The clinical studies utilized an application procedure that followed maximal use conditions (product applied as 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 75% of the body surface area, 4 times a day). The case study chemicals were first reviewed to determine if they were in the applicability domain of the iTTC, and then, the human plasma concentrations were compared to an iTTC limit of 1 µM. When assessed under maximum usage, the external exposure of all chemicals exceeded the external dose TTC limits. By contrast, the internal exposure to all chemicals, except oxybenzone, was an order of magnitude lower than the 1 µM interim iTTC threshold. This work highlights the importance of understanding internal exposure relative to external dose and how the iTTC can be a valuable tool for assessing low-level internal exposures; additionally, the work demonstrates how to use an iTTC, and highlights considerations and refinement opportunities for the approach.","Najjar Abdulkarim, Ellison Corie A, Gregoire Sebastien, Hewitt Nicola J",Archives of toxicology,2023,"Humans, Benzophenones, Risk Assessment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36149470/,"Beiersdorf AG, Unnastrasse 48, 20245, Hamburg, Germany.; Cosmetics Europe, Avenue Herrmann-Debroux 40, 1160, Brussels, Belgium.; L'Oreal Research & Innovation, 1, Avenue Eugène Schueller, 93601, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France.; The Procter & Gamble Company, 8700 Mason Montgomery Road, Cincinnati, OH, 45040, USA.
