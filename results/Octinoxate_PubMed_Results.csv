38704047,Exposure to UV-B filter octylmethoxycinnamate and human health effects: Focus on endocrine disruptor actions.,"Human skin is the first line of photoprotection against UV radiation. However, despite having its defence mechanisms, the photoprotection that the skin exerts is not enough. To protect human skin, the inclusion of UV filters in the cosmetic industry has grown significantly as a photoprotection strategy. Octylmethoxycinnamate, also designated by octinoxate, or 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (CAS number: 5466-77-3) is one of the most widely used UV-B filter in the cosmetic industry. The toxic effects of OMC have alarmed the public, but there is still no consensus in the scientific community about its use. This article aims to provide an overview of the UV filters' photoprotection, emphasizing the OMC and the possible negative effects it may have on the public health. Moreover, the current legislation will be addressed. In summary, the recommendations should be rethought to assess their risk-benefit, since the existing literature warns us to endocrine-disrupting effects of OMC. Further studies should be focus on the toxicity of OMC alone, in mixture and should consider its degradation products, to improve the knowledge of its risk assessment as EDC.","Lorigo Margarida, Quintaneiro Carla, Breitenfeld Luiza, Cairrao Elisa",Chemosphere,2024,"Cinnamates, Humans, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays, Endocrine Disruptors, Risk Assessment, Skin, Cosmetics",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38704047/,"CICS-UBI, Health Sciences Research Centre, University of Beira Interior, 6200-506, Covilhã, Portugal.

30484882,Sunscreen bans: Coral reefs and skin cancer.,"Hawaii will ban two major ingredients of sunscreens. This article reviews the reasons and future directions. Hawaii recently enacted legislation that will ban the use of two major ingredients of the majority of commonly used sunscreens. The reason for the ban is the ingredients' putative deleterious impact on marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. But sunscreens also save lives by decreasing the risk of UV-induced skin cancers. We review both sides of the issue and potential implications for the healthcare system. Coral reefs consist of organisms in delicate equilibria that are susceptible to small changes in their surroundings. Recent natural and man-made disruptions, direct or indirect, such as changes in ocean temperature and chemistry, ingress of invasive species, pathogens, pollution and deleterious fishing practices, have been blamed for the poor health, or even the outright destruction, of some coral reefs. The most popular sunscreen products contain two ingredients-oxybenzone and octinoxate-that have also been implicated in coral toxicity and will be banned. This creates a healthcare dilemma: Will the protection of coral reefs result in an increase in human skin cancers? Concentration estimates and mechanism studies support an association-direct or indirect (via promotion of viral infection)-of sunscreens with bleaching of coral reefs. A ban on the two most common sunscreen ingredients goes into effect in Hawaii on January 1, 2021. Proponents suggest that this is a trend, just the first of many such bans worldwide; opponents warn of a dire increase in human skin cancers. As a result, alternative sunscreen compounds are being sought.","Raffa Robert B, Pergolizzi Joseph V, Taylor Robert, Kitzen Jan M, ",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,2019,"Animals, Anthozoa, Benzophenones, Cinnamates, Consumer Product Safety, Coral Reefs, Hawaii, Humans, Skin Neoplasms, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30484882/,"Kitzen Pharmaceutical Consulting, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.; NEMA Research, Inc., Naples, Florida.; Neumentum, Inc., Palo Alto, California.; University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, Tucson, Arizona."
28534578,Photolysis and cellular toxicities of the organic ultraviolet filter chemical octyl methoxycinnamate and its photoproducts.,"Organic ultraviolet filter chemicals (UVFCs) are the active ingredients used in many sunscreens to protect the skin from UV light; these chemicals have been detected in numerous aquatic environments leading to concerns about how they might affect aquatic organisms and humans. One commonly used organic UVFC is octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), better known by its commercial name, octinoxate. Upon exposure to UV light, OMC degrades rapidly, forming numerous photoproducts, some of which have been previously identified. In this study, we isolated and completely characterized the major products of OMC photolysis, including the two major stable OMC cyclodimers. One of these cyclodimers is a δ-truxinate, resulting from a head-to-head dimerization of two OMC molecules, and the other cyclodimer is an α-truxillate, resulting from a head-to-tail dimerization of two OMC molecules. Additionally, the cellular toxicities of the individual photoproducts were determined; it was found that the parent UVFC, OMC, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, and two cyclodimers are significantly toxic to cells. The photoproduct 2-ethylhexanol is not cytotoxic, demonstrating that different components of OMC photolysate contribute differently to its cellular toxicity. This study thus provides an enhanced understanding of OMC photolysis and gives toxicity data that can be used to better evaluate OMC as a sunscreen agent.","Stein Hannah V, Berg Courtney J, Maung Jessica N, O'Connor Lauren E, Pagano Alexandra E, MacManus-Spencer Laura A, Paulick Margot G",Environmental science.

36260437,"Concentrations, Compound Profiles, and Possible Sources of Organic UV Filters in Human Milk in China.","Ultraviolet (UV) filters are of great concern due to their wide occurrence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Little is known about human exposure to UV filters. A total of 3467 individual human milk samples from 24 Chinese provinces were collected during 2017-2019. The concentrations of 12 UV filters in 100 pooled milk samples were determined. The total UV filter concentration was 78-846 (mean 235 ± 120) ng/g lipid weight. The highest and lowest total mean concentrations were for samples from Qinghai and Sichuan provinces, respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between UV radiation levels and UV concentrations in the samples. The dominant UV filters were 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl) benzotriazole (UV-P) and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), which contributed means of 32 and 22%, respectively, to the total concentrations. Plastic products and sunscreens were probably the sources of UV-P and EHMC in the human milk from China, respectively. The mean 2-(3,5-di-<i>tert</i>-amyl-2-hydroxyphenyl) benzotriazole (UV-328) concentration was 2.6 ± 2.6 ng/g lipid weight. The UV filter profiles were similar to profiles for samples from Japan, the Philippines, and Switzerland but not for samples from Korea and Vietnam. The estimated daily UV filter intake for breastfed infants was below the corresponding reference dose. This was the first large-scale study of UV filters in human milk and will help assess the risks posed.","Liu Yang, Gao Lirong, Qiao Lin, Huang Di, Lyu Bing, Li Jingguang, Wu Yongning, Zheng Minghui",Environmental science & technology,2022,"Humans, Milk, Human, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays, China, Lipids, Water Pollutants, Chemical",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36260437/,"Research Unit of Food Safety, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (No. 2019RU014), NHC Key Lab of Food Safety Risk Assessment, China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment (CFSA), Beijing 100022, China.; State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."
37561120,Comparison between endocrine activity assessed using ToxCast/Tox21 database and human plasma concentration of sunscreen active ingredients/UV filters.,"Sunscreen products are composed of ultraviolet (UV) filters and formulated to reduce exposure to sunlight thereby lessening skin damage. Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity and potential endocrine disrupting (ED) effects of UV filters. The ToxCast/Tox21 program, that is, CompTox, is a high-throughput in vitro screening database of chemicals that identify adverse outcome pathways, key events, and ED potential of chemicals. Using the ToxCast/Tox21 database, octisalate, homosalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and avobenzone, 6 commonly used organic UV filters, were found to have been evaluated. These UV filters showed low potency in these bioassays with most activity detected above the range of the cytotoxic burst. The pathways that were most affected were the cell cycle and the nuclear receptor pathways. Most activity was observed in liver and kidney-based bioassays. These organic filters and their metabolites showed relatively weak ED activity when tested in bioassays measuring estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), thyroid receptor, and steroidogenesis activity. Except for oxybenzone, all activity in the endocrine assays occurred at concentrations greater than the cytotoxic burst. Moreover, except for oxybenzone, plasma concentrations (Cmax) measured in humans were at least 100× lower than bioactive (AC50/ACC) concentrations that produced a response in ToxCast/Tox21 assays. These data are consistent with in vivo animal/human studies showing weak or negligible endocrine activity. In sum, when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence assessment and compared with measured plasma concentrations, the results show these organic UV filters have low intrinsic biological activity and risk of toxicity including endocrine disruption in humans.","Onyango David O, Selman Bastian G, Rose Jane L, Ellison Corie A, Nash J F",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,2023,"Animals, Humans, Sunscreening Agents, Benzophenones, Receptors, Estrogen",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37561120/,"Global Product Stewardship, The Procter & Gamble Company, Mason, Ohio 45040, USA."
28235592,Steroid profiling in H295R cells to identify chemicals potentially disrupting the production of adrenal steroids.,"The validated OECD test guideline 456 based on human adrenal H295R cells promotes measurement of testosterone and estradiol production as read-out to identify potential endocrine disrupting chemicals. This study aimed to establish optimal conditions for using H295R cells to detect chemicals interfering with the production of key adrenal steroids. H295R cells' supernatants were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based steroid profiling, and the influence of experimental conditions including time and serum content was assessed. Steroid profiles were determined before and after incubation with reference compounds and chemicals to be tested for potential disruption of adrenal steroidogenesis. The H295R cells cultivated according to the OECD test guideline produced progestins, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens but only very low amounts of testosterone. However, testosterone contained in Nu-serum was metabolized during the 48h incubation. Thus, inclusion of positive and negative controls and a steroid profile of the complete medium prior to the experiment (t=0h) was necessary to characterize H295R cells' steroid production and indicate alterations caused by exposure to chemicals. Among the tested chemicals, octyl methoxycinnamate and acetyl tributylcitrate resembled the corticosteroid induction pattern of the positive control torcetrapib. Gene expression analysis revealed that octyl methoxycinnamate and acetyl tributylcitrate enhanced CYP11B2 expression, although less pronounced than torcetrapib. Further experiments need to assess the toxicological relevance of octyl methoxycinnamate- and acetyl tributylcitrate-induced corticosteroid production. In conclusion, the extended profiling and appropriate controls allow detecting chemicals that act on steroidogenesis and provide initial mechanistic evidence for prioritizing chemicals for further investigations.","Strajhar Petra, Tonoli David, Jeanneret Fabienne, Imhof Raphaella M, Malagnino Vanessa, Patt Melanie, Kratschmar Denise V, Boccard Julien, Rudaz Serge, Odermatt Alex",Toxicology,2017,"Adrenal Glands, Cell Line, Tumor, Cinnamates, Citrates, Colforsin, Endocrine Disruptors, Endpoint Determination, Estradiol, Gene Expression Regulation, Guidelines as Topic, Humans, Quinolines, RNA, Messenger, Reproducibility of Results, Steroids, Testosterone, Toxicity Tests",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28235592/,"Division of Molecular and Systems Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 50, 4056 Basel, Switzerland.; Division of Molecular and Systems Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 50, 4056 Basel, Switzerland; Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology (SCAHT), Universities of Basel and Geneva, Basel, Switzerland.; Division of Molecular and Systems Toxicology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 50, 4056 Basel, Switzerland; Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology (SCAHT), Universities of Basel and Geneva, Basel, Switzerland.

40208192,Mode of action approach supports a lack of carcinogenic potential of six organic UV filters.,"Ultraviolet (UV) filters, the active ingredients in sunscreens, have been used for several decades to reduce the risk of acute and chronic damage to the skin from solar UV radiation, which can lead to skin cancer. Based on recent clinical studies showing that certain UV filters are absorbed systemically at low levels in humans, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested supplementing existing safety data with preclinical studies including oral and dermal 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies. Although the conduct of 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies has been the standard approach for evaluating the carcinogenic potential of chemicals and new drugs for approximately 6 decades, there are multiple examples showing that such studies are not predictive of human cancer risk. Given these concerns with 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies, we have developed and applied an alternative approach for supplementing existing data related to carcinogenic potential for six of the most commonly used UV filters in sunscreen products (i.e. avobenzone, ensulizole, homosalate, octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene). This approach evaluates their mode of action (MOA) based on <i>in vivo</i>, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in silico</i> data combined with an assessment of exposure margins. This approach is based on the substantial progress in understanding the MOAs that are responsible for tumor induction in humans. It is consistent with those being developed by the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and other health authorities to replace 2-year carcinogenicity studies given their limitations and questionable biological relevance to humans. The available data for the six UV filters show that they are not genotoxic and show no evidence of biologically relevant carcinogenic MOAs. Furthermore, their systemic exposure levels in humans fall well below concentrations at which they have biologic activity. In conclusion, these data support the continued safe use of these six filters in sunscreen products.","Cohen Samuel M, Boobis Alan R, Jacobson-Kram David, Schoeny Rita, Rosol Thomas J, Williams Gary M, Kaminski Norbert E, Eichenbaum Gary M, Guengerich F Peter, Nash J F",Critical reviews in toxicology,2025,"Ultraviolet Rays, Sunscreening Agents, Animals, Mice, Rats, Humans, Carcinogenicity Tests, Carcinogens, Propiophenones, Benzimidazoles, Sulfonic Acids, Salicylates, Cinnamates, Acrylates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40208192/,"Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; Histology Core Facility and Biomedical Sciences, Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA.; National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Oaktree Life Sciences Consulting, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.; Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.; Procter & Gamble, Mason, OH, USA.; Rita Schoeny, LLC, Washington, DC, USA.; ToxRox Consulting, LLC, Bethesda, MD, USA."
31339964,"Organic ultraviolet filters in nearshore waters and in the invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans) in Grenada, West Indies.","Sunscreens and other personal care products use organic ultraviolet (UV) filters such as oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate to prevent damage to human skin. While these compounds are effective at preventing sunburn, they have a demonstrated negative effect on cells and tissues across taxonomic levels. These compounds have a relatively short half-life in seawater but are continuously re-introduced via recreational activities and wastewater discharge, making them environmentally persistent. Because of this, testing seawater samples for the presence of these compounds may not be reflective of their abundance in the environment. Bioaccumulation of organic ultraviolet filters in a high-trophic level predator may provide greater insight to the presence and persistence of these compounds. To address this, the present study collected seawater samples as well as muscle and stomach content samples from the invasive Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) in the nearshore waters of Grenada, West Indies to examine the use of lionfish as potential bioindicator species. Seawater and lionfish samples were collected at four sites that are near point sources of wastewater discharge and that receive a high number of visitors each year. Samples were tested for the presence and concentrations of oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Oxybenzone residues were detected in 60% of seawater samples and OMC residues were detected in 20% of seawater samples. Seawater samples collected in the surface waters near Grenada's main beach had oxybenzone concentrations more than ten times higher than seawater samples collected in less frequently visited areas and the highest prevalence of UV filters in lionfish. Residues of oxybenzone were detected in 35% of lionfish muscle and 4-MBC residues were detected in 12% of lionfish muscle. Padimate-O was not detected in either seawater or lionfish samples. No organic UV filters were detected in lionfish stomach contents. Histopathologic examination of lionfish demonstrated no significant findings attributed to UV filter toxicity. These findings report UV filter residue levels for the first time in inshore waters in Grenada. Results indicate that lionfish may be bioaccumulating residues and may be a useful sentinel model for monitoring organic ultraviolet filters in the Caribbean Sea.","Horricks Ryan A, Tabin Sarah K, Edwards Jonnel J, Lumsden John S, Marancik David P",PloS one,2019,"Animals, Benzophenones, Caribbean Region, Environmental Monitoring, Female, Grenada, Humans, Introduced Species, Male, Perciformes, Seawater, Sentinel Species, Sunscreening Agents, Water Pollutants, Chemical",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31339964/,"Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.; Department of Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, St. George's University, True Blue, Grenada, West Indies."
21534975,Photoprotective effects of methoxycinnamidopropyl polysilsesquioxane.,"A new sunscreen ingredient, methoxycinnamidopropyl polysilsesquioxane (MCP-PSQ), which contains an UV-absorbing p-methoxycinnamoyl group, has been developed synthetically and evaluated using in vitro and in vivo approaches. Previous studies revealed that MCP-PSQ has a raising or boosting effect on the sun protection factor (SPF) of other sunscreen agents. In this study, we demonstrated that MCP-PSQ, an organic/inorganic hybrid compound, has photoprotective effects for human fibroblasts, and for hairless mouse and human skin. MCP-PSQ increases cell viability and suppresses the expression of p53 protein in fibroblasts after UV exposure. In addition, the numbers of sunburn cells and mast cells are reduced by topical application of MCP-PSQ on hairless mouse skin after UV irradiation. A 10% MCP-PSQ cream has higher and similar effects on SPF values for human skin compared to 5% titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and 5% ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), respectively. The SPF value obtained using the MCP-PSQ cream did not drop after UV irradiation of the cream itself. However, higher dose of UV irradiation is required to guarantee the stability or photostability of the formulation. Further, there were no side effects such as erythema, edema, itch or tingling, suggesting that MCP-PSQ is a good sunscreen agent.","Choi Dae-Kyoung, Jung Taek Kyu, Lim Tae-Yeon, Kim Tae-Heung, Kim Young Baek, Lee Jeung-Hoon, Yoon Kyung-Sup, Yoon Tae-Jin",Photochemistry and photobiology,2011,"Absorption, Administration, Topical, Animals, Blotting, Western, Cell Survival, Cinnamates, Drug Stability, Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel, Female, Fibroblasts, Gene Expression, Humans, Hydrocarbons, Aromatic, Mice, Mice, Hairless, Silicon Compounds, Skin, Sunburn, Sunscreening Agents, Titanium, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21534975/,"Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea."
29131088,Development and Evaluation of Lipid Nanoparticles Containing Natural Botanical Oil for Sun Protection: Characterization and in vitro and in vivo Human Skin Permeation and Toxicity.,"The use of sunscreen products is widely promoted by schools, government agencies, and health-related organizations to minimize sunburn and skin damage. In this study, we developed stable solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) containing the chemical UV filter octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC). In parallel, we produced similar stable SLNs in which 20% of the OMC content was replaced by the botanical urucum oil. When these SLNs were applied to the skin of human volunteers, no changes in fluorescence lifetimes or redox ratios of the endogenous skin fluorophores were seen, suggesting that the formulations did not induce toxic responses in the skin. Ex vivo (skin diffusion) tests showed no significant penetration. In vitro studies showed that when 20% of the OMC was replaced by urucum oil, there was no reduction in skin protection factor (SPF), suggesting that a decrease in the amount of chemical filter may be a viable alternative for an effective sunscreen, in combination with an antioxidant-rich vegetable oil, such as urucum. There is a strong trend towards increasing safety of sun protection products through reduction in the use of chemical UV filters. This work supports this approach by producing formulations with lower concentrations of OMC, while maintaining the SPF. Further investigations of SPF in vivo are needed to assess the suitability of these formulations for human use.","Andréo-Filho Newton, Bim Antonio Vinicius Kosiski, Kaneko Telma Mary, Kitice Nidia Ayumi, Haridass Isha N, Abd Eman, Santos Lopes Patricia, Thakur Sachin S, Parekh Harendra S, Roberts Michael S, Grice Jeffrey E, Benson Heather A E, Leite-Silva Vânia Rodrigues",Skin pharmacology and physiology,2018,"Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Cinnamates, Humans, Lipids, Nanoparticles, Permeability, Plant Oils, Skin, Skin Absorption, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29131088/,"Instituto de Ciências Ambientais, Químicas e Farmacêuticas, Departamento de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, UNIFESP-Diadema, São Paulo, Brazil."
35931261,UV-B filter octylmethoxycinnamate-induced vascular endothelial disruption on rat aorta: In silico and in vitro approach.,"Throughout human life, an extensive and varied range of emerging environmental contaminants, called endocrine disruptors (EDCs), cause adverse health effects, including in the cardiovascular (CV) system. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are worryingly one of the leading causes of all mortality and mobility worldwide. The UV-B filter octylmethoxycinnamate (also designated octinoxate, or ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (CAS number: 5466-77-3)) is an EDC widely present in all personal care products. However, to date, there are no studies evaluating the OMC-induced effects on vasculature using animal models to improve human cardiovascular health. This work analysed the effects of OMC on rat aorta vasculature and explored the modes of action implicated in these effects. Our results indicated that OMC relaxes the rat aorta by endothelium-dependent mechanisms through the signaling pathways of cyclic nucleotides and by endothelium-independent mechanisms involving inhibition of L-Type voltage-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (L-Type VOCC). Overall, OMC toxicity on rat aorta may produce hypotension via vasodilation due to excessive NO release and blockade of L-Type VOCC. Moreover, the OMC-induced endothelial dysfunction may also occur by promoting the endothelial release of endothelin-1. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that exposure to OMC alters the reactivity of the rat aorta and highlight that long-term OMC exposure may increase the risk of human CV diseases.","Lorigo Margarida, Cairrao Elisa",Chemosphere,2022,"Animals, Aorta, Cinnamates, Endocrine Disruptors, Endothelin-1, Endothelium, Endothelium, Vascular, Humans, Nucleotides, Cyclic, Rats",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35931261/,"CICS-UBI, Health Sciences Research Centre, University of Beira Interior, 6200-506, Covilhã, Portugal; FCS - UBI, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Beira Interior, 6200-506, Covilhã, Portugal; C4-UBI, Cloud Computing Competence Centre, University of Beira Interior, 6200-501, Covilhã, Portugal.

39709705,A novel approach for unveiling co-occurrence patterns of UV filter mixtures in sunscreens: Prioritization for hazard and risk assessment.,"In recent years, concerns regarding the toxicity of organic UV filters in sunscreen products have increased. While sunscreen products contain multiple UV filters in combination, current understanding on their co-occurrence patterns and mixture toxicities is still limited. This study utilized a public database, ""Hwahae"", and analyzed 2183 sunscreen products marketed in South Korea as of 2019, using an association rule mining (ARM) to elucidate their co-occurrence patterns. We identified twenty-two UV filters in the sunscreen products, with titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) being the most prevalent (68 %), followed by ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC, 60 %) and ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS, 49 %). Sunscreen products typically contained a median of five UV filters per product. Usage patterns of UV filter mixtures varied by the target user group of the product, i.e., general, susceptible, and male users. EHMC and EHS were commonly combined in most products, except those marketed for susceptible users. For susceptible users, inorganic UV filters such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and zinc oxide (ZnO) were dominantly used. Combinations of UV filters that provide protection against different types of UV light, e.g., butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM) for UVA, and octocrylene (OCT), EHS, or homosalate (HS) for UVB, were also frequently used together, with high lift values. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that ARM approach can be useful to identify major combinations of UV filters present in sunscreen products, and prioritize the UV filter combinations requiring safety assessment and regulatory attention.","Jo Ah-Reum, Kwon Ba Reum, Lee Inae, Min Jieun, Choi Sohyeon, Park Na-Youn, Kho Younglim, Park Jeongim, Kim Ho, Choi Kyungho",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2025,"Sunscreening Agents, Republic of Korea, Risk Assessment, Ultraviolet Rays, Humans, Titanium, Cinnamates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39709705/,"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, Soonchunhyang University, Asan, South Korea.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.

36149470,Practical application of the interim internal threshold of toxicological concern (iTTC): a case study based on clinical data.,"We present a case study that provides a practical step-by-step example of how the internal Threshold of Toxicological Concern (iTTC) can be used as a tool to refine a TTC-based assessment for dermal exposures to consumer products. The case study uses a theoretical scenario where there are no systemic toxicity data for the case study chemicals (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, octinoxate, and ecamsule). Human dermal pharmacokinetic data following single and repeat dermal exposure to products containing the case study chemicals were obtained from data published by the US FDA. The clinical studies utilized an application procedure that followed maximal use conditions (product applied as 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 75% of the body surface area, 4 times a day). The case study chemicals were first reviewed to determine if they were in the applicability domain of the iTTC, and then, the human plasma concentrations were compared to an iTTC limit of 1 µM. When assessed under maximum usage, the external exposure of all chemicals exceeded the external dose TTC limits. By contrast, the internal exposure to all chemicals, except oxybenzone, was an order of magnitude lower than the 1 µM interim iTTC threshold. This work highlights the importance of understanding internal exposure relative to external dose and how the iTTC can be a valuable tool for assessing low-level internal exposures; additionally, the work demonstrates how to use an iTTC, and highlights considerations and refinement opportunities for the approach.","Najjar Abdulkarim, Ellison Corie A, Gregoire Sebastien, Hewitt Nicola J",Archives of toxicology,2023,"Humans, Benzophenones, Risk Assessment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36149470/,"Beiersdorf AG, Unnastrasse 48, 20245, Hamburg, Germany.; Cosmetics Europe, Avenue Herrmann-Debroux 40, 1160, Brussels, Belgium.; L'Oreal Research & Innovation, 1, Avenue Eugène Schueller, 93601, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France.; The Procter & Gamble Company, 8700 Mason Montgomery Road, Cincinnati, OH, 45040, USA.

15908756,Sunscreen penetration of human skin and related keratinocyte toxicity after topical application.,"Sunscreen skin penetration and safety assessment should be considered together in order to ensure that in vitro cytotoxicity studies examine relevant doses of these organic chemical UV filters to which viable epidermal cells are realistically exposed. In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient topically applied sunscreens penetrated into human viable epidermis to put the local keratinocyte cell populations at risk of toxicity. The penetration and retention of five commonly used sunscreen agents (avobenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, oxybenzone and padimate O) in human skin was evaluated after application in mineral oil to isolated human epidermal membranes. Sunscreen concentration-human keratinocyte culture response curves were then defined using changes in cell morphology and proliferation (DNA synthesis using radiolabelled thymidine uptake studies) as evidence of sunscreens causing toxicity. Following 24 h of human epidermal exposure to sunscreens, detectable amounts of all sunscreens were present in the stratum corneum and viable epidermis, with epidermal penetration most evident with oxybenzone. The concentrations of each sunscreen found in human viable epidermis after topical application, adjusting for skin partitioning and binding effects, were at least 5-fold lower, based on levels detected in viable epidermal cells, than those appearing to cause toxicity in cultured human keratinocytes. It is concluded that the human viable epidermal levels of sunscreens are too low to cause any significant toxicity to the underlying human keratinocytes.","Hayden C G J, Cross S E, Anderson C, Saunders N A, Roberts M S",Skin pharmacology and physiology,2005,"Cells, Cultured, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Humans, Keratinocytes, Skin, Skin Absorption, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15908756/,"Therapeutics Research Unit, University of Queensland, Southern Clinical School, University of Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia."

Despite the high standards set for UV filters, many of them may contribute to the occurrence of adverse effects. The newly synthesised compound K-116, the (<i>E</i>)-cinnamoyl xanthone derivative, could be an alternative. We conducted extended <i>in vitro</i> safety evaluation of compound K-116. The research included assessment of irritation potential on skin tissue, evaluation of penetration through the epidermis, and assessment of phototoxicity, and mutagenicity. Additionally, the eco-safety of compound K-116 was evaluated, including an examination of its degradation pathway in the <i>Cunninghamella echinulata</i> model, as well as <i>in silico</i> simulation of the toxicity of both the parent compound and its degradation products. The research showed that compound K-116 tested in future application conditions is deprived of skin irritant potential additionally it does not penetrate through the epidermis. Results showed that K-116 concentrate is not phototoxic and not mutagenic. The eco-safety studies showed that it undergoes biodegradation in 27% in <i>Cunninghamella echinulata</i> model. The parent compound and formed metabolite are less toxic than reference UV filters (octinoxate and octocrylene).","Popiół Justyna, Gunia-Krzyżak Agnieszka, Słoczyńska Karolina, Piska Kamil, Kocot Natalia, Żelaszczyk Dorota, Krupa Anna, Wójcik-Pszczoła Katarzyna, Marona Henryk, Pękala Elżbieta",Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,2024,"Ultraviolet Rays, Sunscreening Agents, Acrylates, Skin, Humans, Mutagenicity Tests, Animals",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38819995/,"Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Chair of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kraków, Poland.; Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kraków, Poland.; Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kraków, Poland."
10886505,Protection by ultraviolet A and B sunscreens against in situ dipyrimidine photolesions in human epidermis is comparable to protection against sunburn.,"Sunscreens prevent sunburn and may also prevent skin cancer by protecting from ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. We assessed the ability of two sunscreens, with different spectral profiles, to inhibit DNA photodamage in human epidermis in situ. One formulation contained the established ultraviolet B filter octyl methoxycinnamate, whereas the other contained terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid, a new ultraviolet A filter. Both formulations had sun protection factors of 4 when assessed with solar simulating radiation in volunteers of skin type I/II. We tested the hypothesis that sun protection factors would indicate the level of protection against DNA photodamage. Thus, we exposed sunscreen-treated sites to four times the minimal erythema dose of solar simulating radiation, whereas vehicle and control sites were exposed to one minimal erythema dose. We used monoclonal antibodies against thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts and image analysis to quantify DNA damage in skin sections. A dose of four times the minimal erythema dose, with either sunscreen, resulted in comparable levels of thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts to one minimal erythema dose +/- vehicle, providing evidence that the DNA protection factor is comparable to the sun protection factor. The lack of difference between the sunscreens indicates similar action spectra for erythema and DNA photodamage and that erythema is a clinical surrogate for DNA photodamage that may lead to skin cancer.","Young A R, Sheehan J M, Chadwick C A, Potten C S",The Journal of investigative dermatology,2000,"Adolescent, Adult, DNA Damage, Erythema, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pyrimidine Dimers, Skin, Skin Aging, Sunburn, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10886505/,"Department of Environmental Dermatology, St. John's Institute of Dermatology, King's College London, St. Thomas's Hospital, London, UK. antony.r.young@kcl.ac.uk"
