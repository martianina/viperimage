40208192,Mode of action approach supports a lack of carcinogenic potential of six organic UV filters.,"Ultraviolet (UV) filters, the active ingredients in sunscreens, have been used for several decades to reduce the risk of acute and chronic damage to the skin from solar UV radiation, which can lead to skin cancer. Based on recent clinical studies showing that certain UV filters are absorbed systemically at low levels in humans, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested supplementing existing safety data with preclinical studies including oral and dermal 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies. Although the conduct of 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies has been the standard approach for evaluating the carcinogenic potential of chemicals and new drugs for approximately 6 decades, there are multiple examples showing that such studies are not predictive of human cancer risk. Given these concerns with 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies, we have developed and applied an alternative approach for supplementing existing data related to carcinogenic potential for six of the most commonly used UV filters in sunscreen products (i.e. avobenzone, ensulizole, homosalate, octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene). This approach evaluates their mode of action (MOA) based on <i>in vivo</i>, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in silico</i> data combined with an assessment of exposure margins. This approach is based on the substantial progress in understanding the MOAs that are responsible for tumor induction in humans. It is consistent with those being developed by the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and other health authorities to replace 2-year carcinogenicity studies given their limitations and questionable biological relevance to humans. The available data for the six UV filters show that they are not genotoxic and show no evidence of biologically relevant carcinogenic MOAs. Furthermore, their systemic exposure levels in humans fall well below concentrations at which they have biologic activity. In conclusion, these data support the continued safe use of these six filters in sunscreen products.","Cohen Samuel M, Boobis Alan R, Jacobson-Kram David, Schoeny Rita, Rosol Thomas J, Williams Gary M, Kaminski Norbert E, Eichenbaum Gary M, Guengerich F Peter, Nash J F",Critical reviews in toxicology,2025,"Ultraviolet Rays, Sunscreening Agents, Animals, Mice, Rats, Humans, Carcinogenicity Tests, Carcinogens, Propiophenones, Benzimidazoles, Sulfonic Acids, Salicylates, Cinnamates, Acrylates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40208192/,"Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; Histology Core Facility and Biomedical Sciences, Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA.; National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Oaktree Life Sciences Consulting, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.; Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.; Procter & Gamble, Mason, OH, USA.; Rita Schoeny, LLC, Washington, DC, USA.; ToxRox Consulting, LLC, Bethesda, MD, USA."
37561120,Comparison between endocrine activity assessed using ToxCast/Tox21 database and human plasma concentration of sunscreen active ingredients/UV filters.,"Sunscreen products are composed of ultraviolet (UV) filters and formulated to reduce exposure to sunlight thereby lessening skin damage. Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity and potential endocrine disrupting (ED) effects of UV filters. The ToxCast/Tox21 program, that is, CompTox, is a high-throughput in vitro screening database of chemicals that identify adverse outcome pathways, key events, and ED potential of chemicals. Using the ToxCast/Tox21 database, octisalate, homosalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and avobenzone, 6 commonly used organic UV filters, were found to have been evaluated. These UV filters showed low potency in these bioassays with most activity detected above the range of the cytotoxic burst. The pathways that were most affected were the cell cycle and the nuclear receptor pathways. Most activity was observed in liver and kidney-based bioassays. These organic filters and their metabolites showed relatively weak ED activity when tested in bioassays measuring estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), thyroid receptor, and steroidogenesis activity. Except for oxybenzone, all activity in the endocrine assays occurred at concentrations greater than the cytotoxic burst. Moreover, except for oxybenzone, plasma concentrations (Cmax) measured in humans were at least 100× lower than bioactive (AC50/ACC) concentrations that produced a response in ToxCast/Tox21 assays. These data are consistent with in vivo animal/human studies showing weak or negligible endocrine activity. In sum, when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence assessment and compared with measured plasma concentrations, the results show these organic UV filters have low intrinsic biological activity and risk of toxicity including endocrine disruption in humans.","Onyango David O, Selman Bastian G, Rose Jane L, Ellison Corie A, Nash J F",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,2023,"Animals, Humans, Sunscreening Agents, Benzophenones, Receptors, Estrogen",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37561120/,"Global Product Stewardship, The Procter & Gamble Company, Mason, Ohio 45040, USA."
36149470,Practical application of the interim internal threshold of toxicological concern (iTTC): a case study based on clinical data.,"We present a case study that provides a practical step-by-step example of how the internal Threshold of Toxicological Concern (iTTC) can be used as a tool to refine a TTC-based assessment for dermal exposures to consumer products. The case study uses a theoretical scenario where there are no systemic toxicity data for the case study chemicals (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, octinoxate, and ecamsule). Human dermal pharmacokinetic data following single and repeat dermal exposure to products containing the case study chemicals were obtained from data published by the US FDA. The clinical studies utilized an application procedure that followed maximal use conditions (product applied as 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 75% of the body surface area, 4 times a day). The case study chemicals were first reviewed to determine if they were in the applicability domain of the iTTC, and then, the human plasma concentrations were compared to an iTTC limit of 1 µM. When assessed under maximum usage, the external exposure of all chemicals exceeded the external dose TTC limits. By contrast, the internal exposure to all chemicals, except oxybenzone, was an order of magnitude lower than the 1 µM interim iTTC threshold. This work highlights the importance of understanding internal exposure relative to external dose and how the iTTC can be a valuable tool for assessing low-level internal exposures; additionally, the work demonstrates how to use an iTTC, and highlights considerations and refinement opportunities for the approach.","Najjar Abdulkarim, Ellison Corie A, Gregoire Sebastien, Hewitt Nicola J",Archives of toxicology,2023,"Humans, Benzophenones, Risk Assessment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36149470/,"Beiersdorf AG, Unnastrasse 48, 20245, Hamburg, Germany.; Cosmetics Europe, Avenue Herrmann-Debroux 40, 1160, Brussels, Belgium.; L'Oreal Research & Innovation, 1, Avenue Eugène Schueller, 93601, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France.; The Procter & Gamble Company, 8700 Mason Montgomery Road, Cincinnati, OH, 45040, USA.

38557457,Market analysis of the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals in cosmetic products intended for oncological patients and other vulnerable groups.,"There is growing concern about the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in cosmetics. We aimed to identify the main cosmetic ingredients with suspected endocrine-disrupting properties, and analyse their presence in current marketed products. Particular attention was given to products intended for susceptible (due to physiological status) and vulnerable (due to specific pathologies) groups with a view to informing cosmetologists and related health professionals of the scientific basis and current status of any concerns. Suspected EDCs used as cosmetic ingredients, included in lists published by regulatory agencies, were documented and investigated by weight of evidence analysis based on endocrine-related toxicity studies. In total, 49 suspected EDCs were identified from a sample of over a thousand cosmetic products marketed in the European Union. Suspected EDCs were found in approximately one third of products, with a similar frequency in products intended for susceptible and vulnerable groups. Avobenzone (CAS number:70356-09-1), octisalate (CAS number: 118-60-5), and butylated hydroxytoluene (CAS number: 128-37-0) were mostly commonly identified. The presence of EDCs was particularly high for sun care cosmetic products. Our results highlight potentially significant exposure through cosmetics to substances currently studied by regulatory institutions as suspected endocrine disrupters. EDCs are not yet universally regulated, and informing health professionals and educating the population as a precaution are options to reduce individual exposure levels, especially in vulnerable and susceptible groups. Special recommendations are needed for products intended for oncological patients.","Fernández-Martín María-Elena, Tarazona José V",European journal of dermatology : EJD,2024,"Humans, Endocrine Disruptors, Cosmetics, Butylated Hydroxytoluene",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38557457/,"Risk Assessment Unit, Spanish National Environmental Health Centre, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Ministry of Science and Innovation.
