23668403,Butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane.,"A comprehensive profile on Butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane, one of the most commonly used ultraviolet (UV) filters in topical sunscreen products, is prepared. This UV filter, often referred to as Avobenzone, has its main absorbance in the UVA I region of the spectrum and is susceptible to photodegradation. The profile contains the following sections: general information, use and mechanism of action, method of preparation, physical characteristics, methods of analysis, stability, and toxicity. The physical characteristics section includes the melting range, differential scanning calorimetry, partition coefficient, ionization constant, solubility, and UV, infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR and (13)C NMR) and mass spectrometry and X-ray powder diffractometry. The method of analysis section in addition to compendial identification and purity and assay methods includes thin-layer gas and high-performance liquid chromatography. The photostability and photostabilization of Butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane, in addition to its toxicity, are also documented.","Kockler Jutta, Robertson Sherryl, Oelgemöller Michael, Davies Murray, Bowden Bruce, Brittain Harry G, Glass Beverley D","Profiles of drug substances, excipients, and related methodology",2013,"Alkanes, Animals, Chalcones, Drug Stability, Humans, Propiophenones, Spectrum Analysis, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23668403/,"School of Pharmacy and Molecular Science, James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia."
37758070,Single and mixture toxicity evaluation of avobenzone and homosalate to male zebrafish and H295R cells.,"Avobenzone and homosalate are widely used in sunscreens to provide ultraviolet (UV) protection, either as single compounds or in combination. Some UV filters exhibit estrogenic or anti-androgenic activities, however, studies regarding their interactions and toxicity in mixtures are limited. In this study, the effect of the toxicity of a binary mixture comprising avobenzone (0.72 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) and homosalate (1.02 and 103 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) on steroid hormone biosynthesis were investigated using male zebrafish and human adrenocortical carcinoma (H295R) cells. In fish exposed to homosalate, a significant decrease in the gonadosomatic index, testosterone level, and transcription of several genes (e.g, hsd3b2, cyp17a1, and hsd17b1) and a significant increase in the hepatosomatic index, liver steatosis, 17β-estradiol level, and transcription of vtg gene were observed. These results suggest that estrogenic and anti-androgenic effects of homosalate were mediated by the steroidogenic pathway. The presence of 0.72 μg L<sup>-1</sup> of avobenzone augmented the anti-androgenic responses in male fish. The testosterone level in the H295R cells were significantly decreased after they were exposed to homosalate alone or in combination with avobenzone, which is consistent with observations in male zebrafish. Further studies need to be conducted to understand the endocrine disrupting properties of long-term exposure to substances typically used in sunscreens.","Lee Sujin, Ka Yujin, Lee Bomi, Lee Inhye, Seo Ye Eun, Shin Hyewon, Kho Younglim, Ji Kyunghee",Chemosphere,2023,"Animals, Male, Humans, Zebrafish, Sunscreening Agents, Estrone, Androgen Antagonists, Testosterone, Endocrine Disruptors, Water Pollutants, Chemical",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37758070/,"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea.; Department of Environmental Health, Graduate School at Yongin University, Yongin, Gyeonggi, 17092, Republic of Korea.; Department of Environmental Health, Graduate School at Yongin University, Yongin, Gyeonggi, 17092, Republic of Korea.

38124640,Chlorination of UV Filters with Antioxidant Shield in Swimming Pool Waters - Products Identification and Toxicity Assessment.,"This work summarizes our research on synthesis, characterization and toxicity of selected UV-A filters and their antioxidant shield in commercial formulation - resveratrol. Benzophenone type of UV filters react under disinfection conditions with chlorine and form different mono- and dichlorinated products, while dibenzoylmethane derivatives, such as avobenzone, react with chlorine and form two main bridge chlorinated products followed by numerous chlorinated species at the advanced stages of the process. Resveratrol showed three main susceptible centers to chlorination, starting from the electrophilic addition to the double bond and continuing with the chlorination of the phenolic moieties. Several experiments conducted under different disinfection conditions (pool/sea water, addition of salts, irradiation) showed basically similar chlorination patters with some variations in terms of product formation. The results of toxicity assessment using different test organisms (Vibrio fischeri, microalgae, daphnids) have shown different sensitivity of testing organisms to the parent UV filters in comparison with chlorinated products as well as different toxicity for specific UV filter in comparison to the others. As the closing loop of all experiments in the laboratory, an up-scaling to the real human skin is presented.","Bavcon Kralj Mojca, Albert T Lebedev, Trebše Polonca",Acta chimica Slovenica,2023,"Humans, Antioxidants, Halogenation, Chlorine, Resveratrol, Swimming Pools, Water, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Water Purification",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38124640/,. mocehops@yandex.ru.; . polonca.trebse@zf.uni-lj.si.; Doc.dr.. mojca.kralj@zf.uni-lj.si.
32120142,Identification of avobenzone by-products formed by various disinfectants in different types of swimming pool waters.,"The increased use of sunscreens and other cosmetics containing UV filters causes human and environmental burden. Avobenzone is a widely used UV filter. In its pure form it is known to undergo several transformations including photo-isomerisation, photodegradation, and halogenation. Over 60 disinfection by-products were identified as transformation products of avobenzone in different disinfection reactions of chlorination and bromination in fresh and seawater. Two occasional samples of swimming pool water demonstrated the presence of some of these by-products at noticeable levels as judged by GC-MS peak areas. Although the toxicity of the majority of these products remain unknown, chlorinated phenols and acetophenones are known to be rather toxic. Aquatic bromination of avobenzone resulted in the identification of 33 disinfection by-products (DBPs). Many of them contain bromine in the molecular structure. Addition of copper salt slightly decreases conversion rate simultaneously increasing the levels of major brominated products. Photostability of 3 commercial sunscreen products (solar protection factor 30) containing avobenzone was studied under different experimental conditions including UVA/UVB, UVC photostimulation and chlorination. The commercial sunscreen products have completely different enhancing and inhibitory effect on avobenzone degradation under UVC light. The complex composition of commercial products caused also a protective shield in case of chlorinated solutions of commercial formulations exposed to chlorine and UVA/UVB light at the same time.","Lebedev Albert T, Bavcon Kralj Mojca, Polyakova Olga V, Detenchuk Elena A, Pokryshkin Sergey A, Trebše Polonca",Environment international,2020,"Chlorine, Disinfectants, Disinfection, Halogenation, Humans, Propiophenones, Swimming Pools, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Water Purification",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32120142/,"Chemistry Department, M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow 119991, Leninskie Gory 1/3, Russian Federation.; Chemistry Department, M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow 119991, Leninskie Gory 1/3, Russian Federation; Core Facility Center ""Arktika"", Northern (Arctic) Federal University, nab.

31470219,Systemic availability of lipophilic organic UV filters through dermal sunscreen exposure.,"Chemical UV filters are common components in sunscreens and cosmetic products and used to protect the skin against harmful effects of sunlight like sunburn. However, the effectiveness of sunscreens in the prevention of skin cancer is in some parts still controversial. Meanwhile, questions about negative effects of the chemical UV filters on human health arise and request an effective risk assessment. Real-life exposure data in humans after application of these products are still rare. Thus, we explored whether and to what extent UV filters are absorbed through the skin into the human body. Plasma and urine samples from 20 healthy volunteers were collected before, during and after a real-life exposure scenario (1st application: 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>; 2nd and 3rd (after 2 and 4 h): 1 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> each) using a commercial sunscreen formulation for one day. These samples were analyzed for their content of the currently prominent UV filters octocrylene and avobenzone as well as 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylic acid (CDAA) as the main octocrylene metabolite by using different liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometric procedures. Following dermal sunscreen exposure, avobenzone, octocrylene and CDAA reached concentrations up to 11 μg/L, 25 μg/L and 1352 μg/L in plasma. In urine detection rates of avobenzone and octocrylene were low while CDAA showed a high detection rate and reached up to 5207 μg/g creatinine. Kinetic models could be fitted for octocrylene and CDAA in plasma and CDAA in urine. Concentration peaks were reached between 10 and 16 h after first application and half-life periods were in the range of 1.5 to 2 days. The lipophilic UV filter octocrylene and its metabolite CDAA showed a much slower elimination than other more hydrophilic UV filters. Concordantly, the metabolite CDAA in particular showed a markedly increased renal excretion over the whole sampling period and indicated high internal exposure to OC. Real-life sunscreen usage leads to considerable bioavailability of organic UV filters and their metabolites which is rarely seen for other environmental exposures. A combined monitoring of the parent compound and its metabolites is important to fully address internal exposure to the UV filter in humans. Considering the kinetic profiles a prolonged systemic release due to depot formation in skin and a potential accumulation through multi-day exposure is presumed. High in-vivo loads call for a critical toxicological assessment of the UV filters and their metabolites.","Hiller Julia, Klotz Katrin, Meyer Sebastian, Uter Wolfgang, Hof Kerstin, Greiner Annette, Göen Thomas, Drexler Hans",Environment international,2019,"Acrylates, Administration, Cutaneous, Adult, Female, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Male, Propiophenones, Skin, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays, Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31470219/,"Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Institute and Outpatient Clinic of Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine, Henkestr. 9-11, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.

37561120,Comparison between endocrine activity assessed using ToxCast/Tox21 database and human plasma concentration of sunscreen active ingredients/UV filters.,"Sunscreen products are composed of ultraviolet (UV) filters and formulated to reduce exposure to sunlight thereby lessening skin damage. Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity and potential endocrine disrupting (ED) effects of UV filters. The ToxCast/Tox21 program, that is, CompTox, is a high-throughput in vitro screening database of chemicals that identify adverse outcome pathways, key events, and ED potential of chemicals. Using the ToxCast/Tox21 database, octisalate, homosalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and avobenzone, 6 commonly used organic UV filters, were found to have been evaluated. These UV filters showed low potency in these bioassays with most activity detected above the range of the cytotoxic burst. The pathways that were most affected were the cell cycle and the nuclear receptor pathways. Most activity was observed in liver and kidney-based bioassays. These organic filters and their metabolites showed relatively weak ED activity when tested in bioassays measuring estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), thyroid receptor, and steroidogenesis activity. Except for oxybenzone, all activity in the endocrine assays occurred at concentrations greater than the cytotoxic burst. Moreover, except for oxybenzone, plasma concentrations (Cmax) measured in humans were at least 100× lower than bioactive (AC50/ACC) concentrations that produced a response in ToxCast/Tox21 assays. These data are consistent with in vivo animal/human studies showing weak or negligible endocrine activity. In sum, when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence assessment and compared with measured plasma concentrations, the results show these organic UV filters have low intrinsic biological activity and risk of toxicity including endocrine disruption in humans.","Onyango David O, Selman Bastian G, Rose Jane L, Ellison Corie A, Nash J F",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,2023,"Animals, Humans, Sunscreening Agents, Benzophenones, Receptors, Estrogen",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37561120/,"Global Product Stewardship, The Procter & Gamble Company, Mason, Ohio 45040, USA."
40208192,Mode of action approach supports a lack of carcinogenic potential of six organic UV filters.,"Ultraviolet (UV) filters, the active ingredients in sunscreens, have been used for several decades to reduce the risk of acute and chronic damage to the skin from solar UV radiation, which can lead to skin cancer. Based on recent clinical studies showing that certain UV filters are absorbed systemically at low levels in humans, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested supplementing existing safety data with preclinical studies including oral and dermal 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies. Although the conduct of 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies has been the standard approach for evaluating the carcinogenic potential of chemicals and new drugs for approximately 6 decades, there are multiple examples showing that such studies are not predictive of human cancer risk. Given these concerns with 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies, we have developed and applied an alternative approach for supplementing existing data related to carcinogenic potential for six of the most commonly used UV filters in sunscreen products (i.e. avobenzone, ensulizole, homosalate, octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene). This approach evaluates their mode of action (MOA) based on <i>in vivo</i>, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in silico</i> data combined with an assessment of exposure margins. This approach is based on the substantial progress in understanding the MOAs that are responsible for tumor induction in humans. It is consistent with those being developed by the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and other health authorities to replace 2-year carcinogenicity studies given their limitations and questionable biological relevance to humans. The available data for the six UV filters show that they are not genotoxic and show no evidence of biologically relevant carcinogenic MOAs. Furthermore, their systemic exposure levels in humans fall well below concentrations at which they have biologic activity. In conclusion, these data support the continued safe use of these six filters in sunscreen products.","Cohen Samuel M, Boobis Alan R, Jacobson-Kram David, Schoeny Rita, Rosol Thomas J, Williams Gary M, Kaminski Norbert E, Eichenbaum Gary M, Guengerich F Peter, Nash J F",Critical reviews in toxicology,2025,"Ultraviolet Rays, Sunscreening Agents, Animals, Mice, Rats, Humans, Carcinogenicity Tests, Carcinogens, Propiophenones, Benzimidazoles, Sulfonic Acids, Salicylates, Cinnamates, Acrylates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40208192/,"Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; Histology Core Facility and Biomedical Sciences, Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA.; National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Oaktree Life Sciences Consulting, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.; Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.; Procter & Gamble, Mason, OH, USA.; Rita Schoeny, LLC, Washington, DC, USA.; ToxRox Consulting, LLC, Bethesda, MD, USA."
38378073,Adverse Effects of Avobenzone on Boar Sperm Function: Disruption of Protein Kinase A Activity and Tyrosine Phosphorylation.,"Avobenzone (AVO), an ultraviolet (UV) filter, is frequently used as an ingredient in personal cosmetics. This UV filter has been found to be easily exposed in swimming pools and beaches, and it has been detected in human urine and blood. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated that AVO exhibits endocrine-disrupting properties. Nevertheless, the effects of AVO on male fertility have not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of AVO on various sperm functions during capacitation. First, boar spermatozoa were treated with various AVO concentrations. After treatment, sperm motility and kinetic characteristics, capacitation status, intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and sperm viability were evaluated. Moreover, Western blot analysis w.as conducted to evaluate protein kinase A (PKA) activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. As a result, AVO treatment significantly decreased total motility, progressive motility, and several kinetic characteristics at high concentrations (50 and 100 μM). Furthermore, the capacitation status dose-dependently decreased. Conversely, no significant differences in acrosome reaction, cell viability, and intracellular ATP levels were observed. However, the intracellular ATP level tended to decrease. In addition, AVO dose-dependently induced abnormal changes in PKA activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. Although AVO did not directly exert a toxic effect on cell viability, it ultimately negatively affected sperm functions through abnormal alterations in PKA activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, the potential implications on male fertility must be considered when contemplating the safe utilization of AVO.","Lee Woo-Jin, Hwang Ju-Mi, Jo Jae-Hwan, Jang Seung-Ik, Jung Eun-Ju, Bae Jeong-Won, Ha Jae Jung, Kim Dae-Hyun, Kwon Woo-Sung","Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)",2024,"Male, Swine, Animals, Humans, Phosphorylation, Sperm Motility, Semen, Spermatozoa, Tyrosine, Adenosine Triphosphate, Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases, Sperm Capacitation, Propiophenones",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38378073/,"Department of Animal Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do 37224, Republic of Korea.; Department of Animal Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do 37224, Republic of Korea.; Department of Animal Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do 37224, Republic of Korea; Department of Animal Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do 37224, Republic of Korea; Research Institute for Innovative Animal Science, Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do 37224, Republic of Korea.

30055310,UVA and UVB formulation phototoxicity in a three-dimensional human skin model: Photodegradation effect.,"In vitro three-dimensional human skin models are an innovative alternative to evaluate cytotoxicity and phototoxicity in the cosmetic industry. The aim of this study was to use a skin model to evaluate the potential toxicity of sunscreen formulations with or without exposure to UV radiation. In addition, the toxicity of these formulations was evaluated after exposure to photodegradation. The results showed toxicity with all formulations/conditions tested, including the control formulation, compared to PBS. Cell viability of photodegraded formulations - prior to the phototoxicity radiation process - was higher, indicating that some formulation components were degraded into products with reduced toxicity. The results also indicated that avobenzone was more unstable/toxic than octyl p-methoxycinnamate under the same test conditions. The sunscreens and their formulations were shown to be toxic to skin model cells to some extent, even when not exposed to UV irradiation; however the biological role of this toxicity is unclear. This result shows the importance of testing sunscreen formulations in real in-use conditions. Finally, since we used an in vitro assay based on a human cell model, this non-invasive technique represents a suitable alternative to animal models for phototoxicity tests in general and could have application in screening new sunscreen products.","Uco Dayane P, Leite-Silva Vânia R, Silva Heron D T, Duque Marcelo D, Grice Jeffrey, Mathor Monica B, Andréo-Filho Newton, Lopes Patricia S",Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2018,"Cells, Cultured, Cinnamates, Dermatitis, Phototoxic, Fibroblasts, Humans, Keratinocytes, Models, Biological, Photolysis, Propiophenones, Skin, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30055310/,"IPEN/CNEN - Energy Research Institute, São Paulo, Brazil.; Therapeutics Research Centre, The University of Queensland School of Medicine, Brisbane, Australia.; UNIFESP - Department of Chemistry, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Diadema, Brazil.; UNIFESP - Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Diadema, Brazil.; UNIFESP - Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Diadema, Brazil.

15908756,Sunscreen penetration of human skin and related keratinocyte toxicity after topical application.,"Sunscreen skin penetration and safety assessment should be considered together in order to ensure that in vitro cytotoxicity studies examine relevant doses of these organic chemical UV filters to which viable epidermal cells are realistically exposed. In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient topically applied sunscreens penetrated into human viable epidermis to put the local keratinocyte cell populations at risk of toxicity. The penetration and retention of five commonly used sunscreen agents (avobenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, oxybenzone and padimate O) in human skin was evaluated after application in mineral oil to isolated human epidermal membranes. Sunscreen concentration-human keratinocyte culture response curves were then defined using changes in cell morphology and proliferation (DNA synthesis using radiolabelled thymidine uptake studies) as evidence of sunscreens causing toxicity. Following 24 h of human epidermal exposure to sunscreens, detectable amounts of all sunscreens were present in the stratum corneum and viable epidermis, with epidermal penetration most evident with oxybenzone. The concentrations of each sunscreen found in human viable epidermis after topical application, adjusting for skin partitioning and binding effects, were at least 5-fold lower, based on levels detected in viable epidermal cells, than those appearing to cause toxicity in cultured human keratinocytes. It is concluded that the human viable epidermal levels of sunscreens are too low to cause any significant toxicity to the underlying human keratinocytes.","Hayden C G J, Cross S E, Anderson C, Saunders N A, Roberts M S",Skin pharmacology and physiology,2005,"Cells, Cultured, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Humans, Keratinocytes, Skin, Skin Absorption, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15908756/,"Therapeutics Research Unit, University of Queensland, Southern Clinical School, University of Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia."
36149470,Practical application of the interim internal threshold of toxicological concern (iTTC): a case study based on clinical data.,"We present a case study that provides a practical step-by-step example of how the internal Threshold of Toxicological Concern (iTTC) can be used as a tool to refine a TTC-based assessment for dermal exposures to consumer products. The case study uses a theoretical scenario where there are no systemic toxicity data for the case study chemicals (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, octinoxate, and ecamsule). Human dermal pharmacokinetic data following single and repeat dermal exposure to products containing the case study chemicals were obtained from data published by the US FDA. The clinical studies utilized an application procedure that followed maximal use conditions (product applied as 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 75% of the body surface area, 4 times a day). The case study chemicals were first reviewed to determine if they were in the applicability domain of the iTTC, and then, the human plasma concentrations were compared to an iTTC limit of 1 µM. When assessed under maximum usage, the external exposure of all chemicals exceeded the external dose TTC limits. By contrast, the internal exposure to all chemicals, except oxybenzone, was an order of magnitude lower than the 1 µM interim iTTC threshold. This work highlights the importance of understanding internal exposure relative to external dose and how the iTTC can be a valuable tool for assessing low-level internal exposures; additionally, the work demonstrates how to use an iTTC, and highlights considerations and refinement opportunities for the approach.","Najjar Abdulkarim, Ellison Corie A, Gregoire Sebastien, Hewitt Nicola J",Archives of toxicology,2023,"Humans, Benzophenones, Risk Assessment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36149470/,"Beiersdorf AG, Unnastrasse 48, 20245, Hamburg, Germany.; Cosmetics Europe, Avenue Herrmann-Debroux 40, 1160, Brussels, Belgium.; L'Oreal Research & Innovation, 1, Avenue Eugène Schueller, 93601, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France.; The Procter & Gamble Company, 8700 Mason Montgomery Road, Cincinnati, OH, 45040, USA.

38557457,Market analysis of the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals in cosmetic products intended for oncological patients and other vulnerable groups.,"There is growing concern about the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in cosmetics. We aimed to identify the main cosmetic ingredients with suspected endocrine-disrupting properties, and analyse their presence in current marketed products. Particular attention was given to products intended for susceptible (due to physiological status) and vulnerable (due to specific pathologies) groups with a view to informing cosmetologists and related health professionals of the scientific basis and current status of any concerns. Suspected EDCs used as cosmetic ingredients, included in lists published by regulatory agencies, were documented and investigated by weight of evidence analysis based on endocrine-related toxicity studies. In total, 49 suspected EDCs were identified from a sample of over a thousand cosmetic products marketed in the European Union. Suspected EDCs were found in approximately one third of products, with a similar frequency in products intended for susceptible and vulnerable groups. Avobenzone (CAS number:70356-09-1), octisalate (CAS number: 118-60-5), and butylated hydroxytoluene (CAS number: 128-37-0) were mostly commonly identified. The presence of EDCs was particularly high for sun care cosmetic products. Our results highlight potentially significant exposure through cosmetics to substances currently studied by regulatory institutions as suspected endocrine disrupters. EDCs are not yet universally regulated, and informing health professionals and educating the population as a precaution are options to reduce individual exposure levels, especially in vulnerable and susceptible groups. Special recommendations are needed for products intended for oncological patients.","Fernández-Martín María-Elena, Tarazona José V",European journal of dermatology : EJD,2024,"Humans, Endocrine Disruptors, Cosmetics, Butylated Hydroxytoluene",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38557457/,"Risk Assessment Unit, Spanish National Environmental Health Centre, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Ministry of Science and Innovation.
