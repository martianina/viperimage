25207381,Sunscreens.,"Sunscreens have become since more than 40 years the most popular means of protection against UV radiation (UVR) in Western countries. Organic and inorganic filters with different absorption spectrum exist. They filter or scatter UVR. Protection from UVB is quantified as a minimal erythema dose-based sun protection factor. UVA protection testing is less standardized: Persistent pigment darkening and critical wavelength are currently used methods. Marketing and labeling of sunscreens underlay national regulation which explains major differences between the European and the US sunscreen market. Sunscreens are most performing in sunburn prevention. Broad spectrum UVB and UVA protection and regular application in sufficient amounts are essential for prevention of skin cancers, UV-induced immunosuppression, and skin aging. A significant benefit from regular sunscreen use has not yet been demonstrated for primary prevention of basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Concerning the prevention of actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinomas, and skin aging, the effect of sunscreens is significant, but it remains incomplete. Some organic UV filters (PABA derivatives, cinnamates, benzophenones, and octocrylene) have been described to cause photoallergy. Percutaneous absorption and endocrine disrupting activity of small-sized organic and nano-sized inorganic UV filters have been reported. On lesional skin and in pediatric settings, these products should be used with caution. Cutaneous vitamin D synthesis depending on skin-carcinogenic UVB radiation, the potential risk of vitamin D deficiency by sunscreen use has become a major subject of public health debate. Sunscreens indeed impair vitamin D synthesis if they are used in the recommended amount of 2 mg/cm2, but not in lesser thickness below 1.5 mg/cm2 that corresponds better to what users apply in real life conditions. Large molecular last generation UVB-UVA broad spectrum sunscreens have a better benefit-risk ratio than former organic filters: They offer better protection in the UVA band, they are non toxic and non allergenic. A better outcome of sunscreen efficacy especially in primary skin cancer prevention may be achieved with these molecules.",Bens Guido,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2014,"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation, Humans, Keratosis, Actinic, Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced, Radiometry, Skin, Skin Aging, Skin Neoplasms, Sunburn, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays, Vitamin D, Vitamin D Deficiency",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25207381/,
34438487,Comparative physicochemical properties and toxicity of organic UV filters and their photocatalytic transformation products.,"Transformation products (TPs) of micropollutants contaminating our water resources have become an emerging issue due to the potential threats they pose to environmental and human health. This study investigated the transformation chemistry, toxicity, physicochemical properties and environmental behavior resulting from photocatalytic transformation of organic UV filters as model micropollutants. 3-Benzylidene camphor (3-BC), 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-HB) and octocrylene (OC) were effectively degraded by UV-A/TiO<sub>2</sub> treatment, with TPs identified and characterized with high resolution mass spectrometry. Nitrated-TPs were observed to be formed in the presence of nitrite and nitrate for 3-BC and 4-HB, suggesting that the transformation process could be altered by components in the water matrix. Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition assay revealed an increase in toxicity of TPs derived from photocatalytic treatment, with quantitative structure-activity relationship model (ECOSAR) predicted an enhanced toxicity of individual TPs' after transformation. Assessment of physicochemical properties and environmental behavior suggested that TPs as compared to parent organic UV filters, may represent even greater hazards due to their increased water solubility, persistence and mobility - in addition to retaining the parent organic UV filter's toxicity. The results provide important information relevant to the potential risks for the selected organic UV filters, and their corresponding transformation products.","Law Japhet Cheuk-Fung, Huang Yanran, Chow Chi-Hang, Lam Tsz-Ki, Leung Kelvin Sze-Yin","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2021,"Aliivibrio fischeri, Humans, Photolysis, Ultraviolet Rays, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Water Purification",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34438487/,"Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, HKSAR, China.; Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, HKSAR, China; HKBU Institute of Research and Continuing Education, Shenzhen Virtual University Park, Shenzhen, China.

34010734,Toxic effects of octocrylene on zebrafish larvae and liver cell line (ZFL).,"Octocrylene (OC) is a broad-spectrum ultraviolet-absorbing chemical used in sunscreen and other personal care products. Its health effects are a concern because it has been detected in water, fish, humans, and food chains. In vivo and in vitro investigations were performed in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae and a zebrafish liver cell line (ZFL), respectively, to understand the potential risks and molecular mechanisms of OC toxicity. The 96-h median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) of OC was determined to be 251.8 μM in larvae and 5.5 μM in ZFL cells. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that OC induced the expression of genes for CYPs (CYP1A, CYP3A65), estrogen receptors (ERα, ERβ1, GPER), vitellogenin (VTG1), and sex determination (BRCA2, CYP19A, DMRT1, SOX9A), both in vitro and in vivo. A whole-transcriptome sequencing method was used to evaluate the gene expression profile of larvae exposed to OC. OC was found to mediate the biosynthesis of estrogens (such as estriol) and affect the antioxidant pathway (glutathione transferases and peroxisome). These findings clarify the toxic effects and molecular mechanisms of OC and support banning its use in cosmetics.","Meng Qi, Yeung Karen, Chan King Ming","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2021,"Acrylates, Animals, Cell Line, Estrogens, Hepatocytes, Humans, Larva, Lethal Dose 50, Liver, Sunscreening Agents, Transcriptome, Vitellogenins, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Zebrafish, Zebrafish Proteins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34010734/,"School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, N.T., Hong Kong.; School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, N.T., Hong Kong.

39461514,"Environmental contamination and risks of organic UV filters: Source, discharge, analytical methods and implications for ecological and human health.","Organic Ultraviolet Filters (OUVFs), commonly used in sunscreens, cosmetics and industrial products to prevent ultraviolet radiation damage, are increasingly detected in the environment due to their widespread use and persistence. This has raised concerns over their toxicity and environmental impact, leading to the classification of OUVF 2-(2H-Benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-ditertpentylphenol (UV-328) as a persistent organic pollutant under the Stockholm Convention in 2023. In this review, current knowledge on the usage, discharge and environmental contamination of OUVFs is briefly discussed. The available analytical methodologies are also reviewed, especially for the extraction and detection of OUVFs in different matrix samples. Finally, the reported levels of OUVFs pollution in surface water, drinking water, aquatic organisms and human urine worldwide are discussed, along with their potential implications for ecological and human health. In general, typical OUVFs ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC) and Octocrylene (OC) have been shown to pose a significant potential risks in the surface waters of multiple countries such as Australia, China, Japan, the United States. Furthermore, while the OUVFs exposure concentrations in drinking water are generally low (below detection limit to 450 ng/L), prolonged exposure may still present potential health risks for humans.","Sun Yue-Hong, Wu Heng-Yu, Xie Feng-Qi, Ma Jia-Ru, Tang Qin-Lin, Chen Yan-Fen, Li Hao, Liu You-Sheng, Ying Guang-Guo",The Science of the total environment,2024,"Sunscreening Agents, Humans, Environmental Monitoring, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Risk Assessment, Ultraviolet Rays, Acrylates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39461514/,"SCNU Environmental Research Institute, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Pollution and Environmental Safety & MOE Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China; School of Environment, South China Normal University, University Town, Guangzhou 510006, China.; SCNU Environmental Research Institute, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Pollution and Environmental Safety & MOE Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China; School of Environment, South China Normal University, University Town, Guangzhou 510006, China.

38608452,Enhanced sun protection factor of octocrylene with green tea and bhringraj extracts.,"The aim of this study of sun protection factor boosting effect sunscreen compositions with herbal extract and combination with octocrylene. The standardized herbal extracts procured and studied their sun protection Factors. Camellia Sinensis (Green tea) leaf Extract, Eclipta prostrata (bhringraj) leaf extract are selected for the development of the herbal sunscreen composition along with octocrylene as synthetic sunscreen. The developed sunscreen composition contains defined concentration of herbal extracts and octocrylene were evaluated for their different physicochemical properties and stability. Sun protection factor boosting effect of herbal extracts is studied combination with octocrylene. Invitro SPF studied for herbal extract individually and combination with octocrylene. The results of Invitro SPF study revealed the presence of green tea extract and, Eclipta prostrata (bhringraj) leaf extract shows excellent sun protection factor (SPF) boosting value of sunscreen composition containing 5% concentration of herbal extract and octocrylene. The sunscreen formulation containing 5% herbal extracts are stable for 12 weeks in an oven (45 °C). The findings of this in-vitro SPF study revealed a sun protection boosting capacity of green tea extract and bhringraj extract confirmed. The over exposure of human skin to Ultra-Violet Radiation (UVR) can trigger photodamage, UV burn, pigmentation, erythema, and enhance the chance of dermal carcinoma. UVR causes DNA damage, which leads to dermal cancer. Daily sunscreens protect the skin from the adverse effects of sun rays, especially UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA (320-400 nm). The ozone layer filters UVC (200-290 nm) radiation when it enters into atmosphere of the earth. UVB causes sunburn, photo damage and cause mutagenic changes in nucleic acids. UVA increases ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) accumulation. ROS is responsible for cell repair which leads to carcinogenesis, and the cause of photodamage. Herbal extracts contain polyphenols, and flavonoids act as a natural sunscreen that will filter Ultra-Violet (UVB) light and contain antioxidant characteristics to modulate the photo-oxidative damage that results from UV-induced Reactive Oxygen Species production. The UVR protection of most herbal extracts are required to attain the higher UV protection in the sun care products. The approaches for preparing sun care products with higher Sun Protection Factor (SPF) possible through Oil in water formulation with herbal extract combinations of octocrylene. The developed sunscreen composition containing different concentration of herbal extracts were evaluated for their other physicochemical properties and stability. Invitro SPF was studied for Camellia Sinensis (Green tea) Leaf Extract and Eclipta prostrata (bhringraj) leaf extract individually and in combination with octocrylene. The results of the Invitro SPF study revealed the Camellia Sinensis (Green tea) Leaf Extract with octocrylene shows better Sun protection factor than Eclipta prostrata (bhringraj) leaf extract with octocrylene. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) enhancement value of sunscreen compositions was compared to both sunscreen macroemulsion and nanoemulsion.","M Pasupathi, B Natarajan, T Kumar",Cutaneous and ocular toxicology,2024,"Sunscreening Agents, Plant Extracts, Humans, Sun Protection Factor, Acrylates, Ultraviolet Rays, Plant Leaves, Camellia sinensis, Tea",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38608452/,"Cavinkare Private Limited, Teynampet, Chennai.; Department of Chemistry, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, Chennai."
31470219,Systemic availability of lipophilic organic UV filters through dermal sunscreen exposure.,"Chemical UV filters are common components in sunscreens and cosmetic products and used to protect the skin against harmful effects of sunlight like sunburn. However, the effectiveness of sunscreens in the prevention of skin cancer is in some parts still controversial. Meanwhile, questions about negative effects of the chemical UV filters on human health arise and request an effective risk assessment. Real-life exposure data in humans after application of these products are still rare. Thus, we explored whether and to what extent UV filters are absorbed through the skin into the human body. Plasma and urine samples from 20 healthy volunteers were collected before, during and after a real-life exposure scenario (1st application: 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>; 2nd and 3rd (after 2 and 4 h): 1 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> each) using a commercial sunscreen formulation for one day. These samples were analyzed for their content of the currently prominent UV filters octocrylene and avobenzone as well as 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylic acid (CDAA) as the main octocrylene metabolite by using different liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometric procedures. Following dermal sunscreen exposure, avobenzone, octocrylene and CDAA reached concentrations up to 11 μg/L, 25 μg/L and 1352 μg/L in plasma. In urine detection rates of avobenzone and octocrylene were low while CDAA showed a high detection rate and reached up to 5207 μg/g creatinine. Kinetic models could be fitted for octocrylene and CDAA in plasma and CDAA in urine. Concentration peaks were reached between 10 and 16 h after first application and half-life periods were in the range of 1.5 to 2 days. The lipophilic UV filter octocrylene and its metabolite CDAA showed a much slower elimination than other more hydrophilic UV filters. Concordantly, the metabolite CDAA in particular showed a markedly increased renal excretion over the whole sampling period and indicated high internal exposure to OC. Real-life sunscreen usage leads to considerable bioavailability of organic UV filters and their metabolites which is rarely seen for other environmental exposures. A combined monitoring of the parent compound and its metabolites is important to fully address internal exposure to the UV filter in humans. Considering the kinetic profiles a prolonged systemic release due to depot formation in skin and a potential accumulation through multi-day exposure is presumed. High in-vivo loads call for a critical toxicological assessment of the UV filters and their metabolites.","Hiller Julia, Klotz Katrin, Meyer Sebastian, Uter Wolfgang, Hof Kerstin, Greiner Annette, Göen Thomas, Drexler Hans",Environment international,2019,"Acrylates, Administration, Cutaneous, Adult, Female, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Male, Propiophenones, Skin, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays, Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31470219/,"Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Institute and Outpatient Clinic of Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine, Henkestr. 9-11, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.

37647541,"Concentrations, Profiles, and Health Risks of Organic Ultraviolet Filters in Eight Food Categories Determined through the Sixth Chinese Total Diet Study.","Ultraviolet (UV) filters are emerging contaminants that have been found in high concentrations in human tissues. Food intake is generally considered to be the primary route of human exposure to contaminants. In this study, 184 composite food samples, prepared from 4268 individual samples in eight categories collected from 23 Chinese provinces for the sixth Chinese total diet study, were analyzed. The total and median UV filter concentrations in food samples were 1.5-68.3 and 7.9 ng/g wet weight, respectively. The highest median concentrations were found in decreasing order in meat, cereals, and legumes. In total, 15 UV filters were analyzed. 2-Ethylhexyl salicylate, homosalate, and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate were dominant and made median contributions of 34.1%, 22.6%, and 14.5%, respectively, and 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-di-<i>tert</i>-pentylphenol contributed the median of 0.03%, of the total UV filter concentrations. The estimated total daily UV filter intake in animal-origin foods and total UV filter concentration in human milk from the same province were significantly correlated (r = 0.44, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Predicted absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination properties led to 10 UV filters being prioritized as most likely to be retained in human tissues. The prioritization results and toxicity assessments indicated that octocrylene and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate have stronger effects in vivo and therefore require more attention than others.","Liu Yang, Gao Lirong, Ai Qiaofeng, Qiao Lin, Li Jingguang, Lyu Bing, Zheng Minghui, Wu Yongning",Environmental science & technology,2023,"Animals, Humans, Food, Cinnamates, Fabaceae, Diet",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37647541/,"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China.; Research Unit of Food Safety, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (No. 2019RU014); NHC Key Lab of Food Safety Risk Assessment, China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment (CFSA), Beijing 100022, China.; State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China."
37485891,Human-Hair-Derived Natural Particles as Multifunctional Sunscreen for Effective UV Protection.,"Excessive ultraviolet (UV) radiation can lead to a series of skin problems. Although commercial sunscreens can protect skin from UV-induced damage to an extent, the side effects caused by such products are still worrisome. Here, inspired by the natural photoprotection effect of human hair, we extracted the multifunctional particles from human hair as sunscreens for UV protection. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> results indicate that hair-derived particles (HDPs) could effectively protect skin from UV radiation. Besides, HDPs retain the antioxidant capability of melanin in hair, which avoids UV-induced oxidative damage. In addition, the unique shape of HDPs can prevent them from penetrating into the skin, thus avoiding potential toxicity. Moreover, owing to their mesoporous structure, the particles can also be used as drug carriers. With the loading of octocrylene, the particles are more effective in blocking UV radiation. This study provides an ingenious tactic for the design and development of sunscreens from a natural substance.","Hong Sheng, Peng Zhangwen, Wu Meiying, Nie Yichu, Yi Yunfei, Cai Hui, Zhang Xian-Zheng",ACS nano,2023,"Humans, Sunscreening Agents, Skin, Ultraviolet Rays, Skin Neoplasms, Hair",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37485891/,"Key Laboratory of Biomedical Polymers of Ministry of Education & Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, People's Republic of China.; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen 518107, People's Republic of China.; Translational Medicine Research Institute, First People's Hospital of Foshan, Foshan 528000, People's Republic of China."
37561120,Comparison between endocrine activity assessed using ToxCast/Tox21 database and human plasma concentration of sunscreen active ingredients/UV filters.,"Sunscreen products are composed of ultraviolet (UV) filters and formulated to reduce exposure to sunlight thereby lessening skin damage. Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity and potential endocrine disrupting (ED) effects of UV filters. The ToxCast/Tox21 program, that is, CompTox, is a high-throughput in vitro screening database of chemicals that identify adverse outcome pathways, key events, and ED potential of chemicals. Using the ToxCast/Tox21 database, octisalate, homosalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and avobenzone, 6 commonly used organic UV filters, were found to have been evaluated. These UV filters showed low potency in these bioassays with most activity detected above the range of the cytotoxic burst. The pathways that were most affected were the cell cycle and the nuclear receptor pathways. Most activity was observed in liver and kidney-based bioassays. These organic filters and their metabolites showed relatively weak ED activity when tested in bioassays measuring estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), thyroid receptor, and steroidogenesis activity. Except for oxybenzone, all activity in the endocrine assays occurred at concentrations greater than the cytotoxic burst. Moreover, except for oxybenzone, plasma concentrations (Cmax) measured in humans were at least 100× lower than bioactive (AC50/ACC) concentrations that produced a response in ToxCast/Tox21 assays. These data are consistent with in vivo animal/human studies showing weak or negligible endocrine activity. In sum, when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence assessment and compared with measured plasma concentrations, the results show these organic UV filters have low intrinsic biological activity and risk of toxicity including endocrine disruption in humans.","Onyango David O, Selman Bastian G, Rose Jane L, Ellison Corie A, Nash J F",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,2023,"Animals, Humans, Sunscreening Agents, Benzophenones, Receptors, Estrogen",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37561120/,"Global Product Stewardship, The Procter & Gamble Company, Mason, Ohio 45040, USA."

Extraction method parameters were optimized: 250 ml of water sample loaded on Chromabond C18 cartridges after adjustment to pH 4 and then eluted with acetonitrile. The mobile phase and the parameters of the mass spectrometer, as well as those of the ionization source, were tested to enhance detection sensitivity. During method validation, the extracted target compounds showed good recoveries (> 68%) with acceptable values in terms of repeatability (RSD<sub>r</sub>) and reproducibility (RSD<sub>R</sub>), where relative standard deviations values were lower than 20%. The validated method was applied to 10 water samples collected from different swimming pools located in Lebanon from which eight UV filters among the eighteen targets compounds were detected at concentrations ranged between 1 and 2526 µg L<sup>-1</sup>. The most detected compounds were padimate-O (OD-PABA) and octocrylene (OCR).

40208192,Mode of action approach supports a lack of carcinogenic potential of six organic UV filters.,"Ultraviolet (UV) filters, the active ingredients in sunscreens, have been used for several decades to reduce the risk of acute and chronic damage to the skin from solar UV radiation, which can lead to skin cancer. Based on recent clinical studies showing that certain UV filters are absorbed systemically at low levels in humans, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested supplementing existing safety data with preclinical studies including oral and dermal 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies. Although the conduct of 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies has been the standard approach for evaluating the carcinogenic potential of chemicals and new drugs for approximately 6 decades, there are multiple examples showing that such studies are not predictive of human cancer risk. Given these concerns with 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies, we have developed and applied an alternative approach for supplementing existing data related to carcinogenic potential for six of the most commonly used UV filters in sunscreen products (i.e. avobenzone, ensulizole, homosalate, octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene). This approach evaluates their mode of action (MOA) based on <i>in vivo</i>, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in silico</i> data combined with an assessment of exposure margins. This approach is based on the substantial progress in understanding the MOAs that are responsible for tumor induction in humans. It is consistent with those being developed by the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and other health authorities to replace 2-year carcinogenicity studies given their limitations and questionable biological relevance to humans. The available data for the six UV filters show that they are not genotoxic and show no evidence of biologically relevant carcinogenic MOAs. Furthermore, their systemic exposure levels in humans fall well below concentrations at which they have biologic activity. In conclusion, these data support the continued safe use of these six filters in sunscreen products.","Cohen Samuel M, Boobis Alan R, Jacobson-Kram David, Schoeny Rita, Rosol Thomas J, Williams Gary M, Kaminski Norbert E, Eichenbaum Gary M, Guengerich F Peter, Nash J F",Critical reviews in toxicology,2025,"Ultraviolet Rays, Sunscreening Agents, Animals, Mice, Rats, Humans, Carcinogenicity Tests, Carcinogens, Propiophenones, Benzimidazoles, Sulfonic Acids, Salicylates, Cinnamates, Acrylates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40208192/,"Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; Histology Core Facility and Biomedical Sciences, Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA.; National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Oaktree Life Sciences Consulting, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.; Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.; Procter & Gamble, Mason, OH, USA.; Rita Schoeny, LLC, Washington, DC, USA.; ToxRox Consulting, LLC, Bethesda, MD, USA."
40200737,Environmental exposure to selected non-persistent endocrine disrupting chemicals and polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder manifesting with symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism, and/or polycystic ovaries. The exact cause of PCOS remains unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic predisposition, insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation, and excessive androgen production. Various environmental factors, especially endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), in addition to genetic and hormonal ones, also may influence PCOS. This is one of the first systematic reviews dealing with the exposure to non-persistent endocrine disrupting chemicals and PCOS. The review summarizes the existing knowledge about the association of EDCs with PCOS based on significant findings on the toxicity of various non-persistent environmental EDCs and polycyclic ovarian syndrome risk. A systematic search of the literature was conducted in order to identify proper studies using PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier, and Springer databases. The results of the studies suggest that there is a positive association between bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, octocrylene, and PCOS. The data concerning triclosan and PCOS were inconclusive. Additionally, no link between the exposures to parabens and PCOS was observed. These results of the presented studies highlight the urgent need for continued research on EDCs and their role in PCOS.

39709705,A novel approach for unveiling co-occurrence patterns of UV filter mixtures in sunscreens: Prioritization for hazard and risk assessment.,"In recent years, concerns regarding the toxicity of organic UV filters in sunscreen products have increased. While sunscreen products contain multiple UV filters in combination, current understanding on their co-occurrence patterns and mixture toxicities is still limited. This study utilized a public database, ""Hwahae"", and analyzed 2183 sunscreen products marketed in South Korea as of 2019, using an association rule mining (ARM) to elucidate their co-occurrence patterns. We identified twenty-two UV filters in the sunscreen products, with titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) being the most prevalent (68 %), followed by ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC, 60 %) and ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS, 49 %). Sunscreen products typically contained a median of five UV filters per product. Usage patterns of UV filter mixtures varied by the target user group of the product, i.e., general, susceptible, and male users. EHMC and EHS were commonly combined in most products, except those marketed for susceptible users. For susceptible users, inorganic UV filters such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and zinc oxide (ZnO) were dominantly used. Combinations of UV filters that provide protection against different types of UV light, e.g., butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM) for UVA, and octocrylene (OCT), EHS, or homosalate (HS) for UVB, were also frequently used together, with high lift values. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that ARM approach can be useful to identify major combinations of UV filters present in sunscreen products, and prioritize the UV filter combinations requiring safety assessment and regulatory attention.","Jo Ah-Reum, Kwon Ba Reum, Lee Inae, Min Jieun, Choi Sohyeon, Park Na-Youn, Kho Younglim, Park Jeongim, Kim Ho, Choi Kyungho",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2025,"Sunscreening Agents, Republic of Korea, Risk Assessment, Ultraviolet Rays, Humans, Titanium, Cinnamates",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39709705/,"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, Soonchunhyang University, Asan, South Korea.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.

In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient topically applied sunscreens penetrated into human viable epidermis to put the local keratinocyte cell populations at risk of toxicity. The penetration and retention of five commonly used sunscreen agents (avobenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, oxybenzone and padimate O) in human skin was evaluated after application in mineral oil to isolated human epidermal membranes. Sunscreen concentration-human keratinocyte culture response curves were then defined using changes in cell morphology and proliferation (DNA synthesis using radiolabelled thymidine uptake studies) as evidence of sunscreens causing toxicity. Following 24 h of human epidermal exposure to sunscreens, detectable amounts of all sunscreens were present in the stratum corneum and viable epidermis, with epidermal penetration most evident with oxybenzone. The concentrations of each sunscreen found in human viable epidermis after topical application, adjusting for skin partitioning and binding effects, were at least 5-fold lower, based on levels detected in viable epidermal cells, than those appearing to cause toxicity in cultured human keratinocytes. It is concluded that the human viable epidermal levels of sunscreens are too low to cause any significant toxicity to the underlying human keratinocytes.","Hayden C G J, Cross S E, Anderson C, Saunders N A, Roberts M S",Skin pharmacology and physiology,2005,"Cells, Cultured, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Humans, Keratinocytes, Skin, Skin Absorption, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15908756/,"Therapeutics Research Unit, University of Queensland, Southern Clinical School, University of Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia."
36149470,Practical application of the interim internal threshold of toxicological concern (iTTC): a case study based on clinical data.,"We present a case study that provides a practical step-by-step example of how the internal Threshold of Toxicological Concern (iTTC) can be used as a tool to refine a TTC-based assessment for dermal exposures to consumer products. The case study uses a theoretical scenario where there are no systemic toxicity data for the case study chemicals (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, octinoxate, and ecamsule). Human dermal pharmacokinetic data following single and repeat dermal exposure to products containing the case study chemicals were obtained from data published by the US FDA. The clinical studies utilized an application procedure that followed maximal use conditions (product applied as 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 75% of the body surface area, 4 times a day). The case study chemicals were first reviewed to determine if they were in the applicability domain of the iTTC, and then, the human plasma concentrations were compared to an iTTC limit of 1 µM. When assessed under maximum usage, the external exposure of all chemicals exceeded the external dose TTC limits. By contrast, the internal exposure to all chemicals, except oxybenzone, was an order of magnitude lower than the 1 µM interim iTTC threshold. This work highlights the importance of understanding internal exposure relative to external dose and how the iTTC can be a valuable tool for assessing low-level internal exposures; additionally, the work demonstrates how to use an iTTC, and highlights considerations and refinement opportunities for the approach.","Najjar Abdulkarim, Ellison Corie A, Gregoire Sebastien, Hewitt Nicola J",Archives of toxicology,2023,"Humans, Benzophenones, Risk Assessment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36149470/,"Beiersdorf AG, Unnastrasse 48, 20245, Hamburg, Germany.; Cosmetics Europe, Avenue Herrmann-Debroux 40, 1160, Brussels, Belgium.; L'Oreal Research & Innovation, 1, Avenue Eugène Schueller, 93601, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France.; The Procter & Gamble Company, 8700 Mason Montgomery Road, Cincinnati, OH, 45040, USA.

38215872,"Prioritization of chemicals in personal care products based on persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) potential: An Indian perspective.","Numerous organic ingredients present in Personal care products (PCPs) are being detected in sewage which has a high potential to impact the environment. These compounds are called as Emerging contaminants (ECs) or Contaminants of emerging concern. However, the information on the source and occurrence of ECs present in PCPs is very minimal. Specifically, information on the persistence (P), bioaccumulation (B) and toxicity (T) is very scarce. The determination of PBT properties is a complex task given the magnitude of chemicals, thus it is necessary to have a tool to quickly screen and prioritize the most important compounds. Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite™ is one such tool authorized by United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) for screening purposes. In the present study, several organic compounds present in the PCPs viz. body lotion, sunscreens, moisturizers, hair dyes, and some hair care products were identified and their PBT property was estimated. The results from the study indicate that the order of increasing occurrence of PBT chemicals is sunscreens > moisturizers > body lotion > hair care products > hair dyes. The prioritized compounds were given rank 1 (maximum concern) to rank 4 (minimum concern). From the results, the compounds octocrylene in sunscreens and butylphenyl methylpropional in body lotions were prioritized as Rank 1.","Balakrishnan Abirami, Senthilkumar Varshini, Rajan Jeyakumaran Sowmiya, John Jabez, Vinodh Kevin, Kannan Uthradevi, Paramasivam Balakrishnan",Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,2024,"Humans, United States, Sunscreening Agents, Environmental Monitoring, Bioaccumulation, Hair Dyes, Cosmetics, Water Pollutants, Chemical",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38215872/,"Department of Biotechnology, Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science, Padur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.; Department of Biotechnology, Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science, Padur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

Despite the high standards set for UV filters, many of them may contribute to the occurrence of adverse effects. The newly synthesised compound K-116, the (<i>E</i>)-cinnamoyl xanthone derivative, could be an alternative. We conducted extended <i>in vitro</i> safety evaluation of compound K-116. The research included assessment of irritation potential on skin tissue, evaluation of penetration through the epidermis, and assessment of phototoxicity, and mutagenicity. Additionally, the eco-safety of compound K-116 was evaluated, including an examination of its degradation pathway in the <i>Cunninghamella echinulata</i> model, as well as <i>in silico</i> simulation of the toxicity of both the parent compound and its degradation products. The research showed that compound K-116 tested in future application conditions is deprived of skin irritant potential additionally it does not penetrate through the epidermis. Results showed that K-116 concentrate is not phototoxic and not mutagenic. The eco-safety studies showed that it undergoes biodegradation in 27% in <i>Cunninghamella echinulata</i> model. The parent compound and formed metabolite are less toxic than reference UV filters (octinoxate and octocrylene).","Popiół Justyna, Gunia-Krzyżak Agnieszka, Słoczyńska Karolina, Piska Kamil, Kocot Natalia, Żelaszczyk Dorota, Krupa Anna, Wójcik-Pszczoła Katarzyna, Marona Henryk, Pękala Elżbieta",Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,2024,"Ultraviolet Rays, Sunscreening Agents, Acrylates, Skin, Humans, Mutagenicity Tests, Animals",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38819995/,"Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Chair of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kraków, Poland.; Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kraków, Poland.; Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kraków, Poland."
