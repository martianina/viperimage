15379874,Prevention of ultraviolet-induced skin pigmentation.,"Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation increases skin pigmentation and usually results in an even darkening of the skin. However, it may also occasionally lead to the development of hyperpigmented lesions due to a local overproduction of pigment. Skin pigmentation is induced both by UVB and UVA rays. The in vivo protection by sunscreens against pigmentation was studied using the determination of a level of protection against pigmentation based on the standardized sun protection factor (SPF) test method. The method includes delayed UVB and UVA pigmentations. The level of prevention against pigmentation was determined 7 days after exposure to solar-simulated radiation by visual assessment. It was calculated using the ratio of the minimal pigmenting dose on protected skin to the minimal pigmenting dose on unprotected skin. Broadspectrum UVB/UVA filters, Mexoryl SX and Mexoryl XL, and complete formula were tested. Protection against pigmentation correlates with the concentration of Mexoryl SX. The levels of protection obtained show a synergetic effect of Mexoryl SX when associated with Mexoryl XL. When different products having the same SPF (same protection against erythema) and different levels of UVA protection are compared, only sunscreen products with a high level of UVA protection show a similar level of protection against sunburn and pigmentation. Products with low UVA protection have a lower capacity of preventing induced pigmentation compared with their efficacy against erythema. These studies have evidenced that SPF determination was not sufficient to account for the efficiency in preventing pigmentation and that UVA protection was an essential part of this prevention.",Moyal Dominique,"Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine",2004,"Adolescent, Adult, Camphanes, Camphor, Drug Synergism, Erythema, Humans, Mesylates, Middle Aged, Radiation Dosage, Skin Pigmentation, Sulfonic Acids, Sunburn, Sunlight, Sunscreening Agents, Time Factors, Triazoles, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15379874/,"L'Oréal Recherche, 8/12 Impasse Barbier, 92117 Clichy, France. dmoyal@rd.loreal.com"
14528058,Percutaneous absorption of Mexoryl SX in human volunteers: comparison with in vitro data.,"The potential human health risk of UV filters depends on their toxicity and the human systemic exposure which is a function of the extent of percutaneous absorption of the topically applied substance into the human organism. Using a 'mass balance' approach, a study was designed to investigate the systemically absorbed dose of [(14)C]-Mexoryl SX((R)) in humans after topical application of a typical sunscreen emulsion. In addition, to assess the correlation with in vitro experiments, the percutaneous absorption of this UVA filter through isolated human skin was measured under identical exposure conditions. When applied in vivo for a period of 4 h, 89-94% of the applied radioactivity was recovered from the wash-off samples. In urine samples, the radioactivity slightly exceeded background levels and corresponded maximally to 0.014% of the topically applied dose. No radioactivity was measured in blood or faeces sampled up to 120 h after application. In vitro, 24 h after a 4-hour application, [(14)C]-Mexoryl SX remained primarily on the skin surface. The mean in vitro absorption over 24 h, adding up the amounts found in the dermis and receptor fluid, was 0.16% of the applied dose. It is concluded from the in vivo pharmacokinetic results that the systemically absorbed dose of [(14)C]-Mexoryl SX is less than 0.1%. The order of magnitude of this value correlates well with the corresponding in vitro data which overestimate the in vivo results as previously observed with other hydrophilic compounds. This study demonstrates that, under realistic exposure conditions, the human systemic exposure to this UVA filter is negligible and poses no risk to human health.","Benech-Kieffer F, Meuling W J A, Leclerc C, Roza L, Leclaire J, Nohynek G",Skin pharmacology and applied skin physiology,2003,"Administration, Topical, Adult, Camphanes, Camphor, Diffusion, Diffusion Chambers, Culture, Half-Life, Humans, In Vitro Techniques, Male, Mesylates, Skin Absorption, Sulfonic Acids, Sunscreening Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14528058/,"Recherche, L'Oréal, Advanced Researched Life Sciences, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France. fbenech@recherche.loreal.com"
30488083,Contradictory effects of chemical filters in UV/ROS-stressed human keratinocyte and fibroblast cells.,"Chemical UV-filters are frequently applied as active ingredients in sunscreen to protect from detrimental effects of UV radiation. Regardless, many of these compounds are not well characterized concerning their capacity to counteract UV induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intracellular ROS release is an early event upon UV exposure and a crucial trigger of reaction cascades that may provoke adverse effects both in short- and long-term. We report a strategy to assess the capacity of UV-filters (ecamsule, oxybenzone and menthyl anthranilate) to counteract UVA/UVB stress in the human keratinocyte HaCaT and the wildtype Fibs E6/E7 fibroblast cell lines. The reduction of ROS levels was taken as primary endpoint. The effect of treatment on the cells' metabolic activity was analyzed as an indicator of viability post-treatment, to investigate potential immediate and late (photo)toxicity. Additionally, the compounds' antioxidative capacity was investigated using an azo-based radical generator. Established antioxidants, quercetin and N-acetylcysteine, were used as controls. Data showed remarkable differences in the mode of action of the chemical UV-filters, ranging from protective to pro-oxidative properties, indicating the need for more detailed mode of action-based investigations. Certainly, additional consideration and evaluation will be necessary to further extrapolate these in vitro data for the assessment of in vivo exposure situations. However, the presented approach enables parallel investigations of photoprotective and phototoxic effects of UV-filters, and thus can complement and extent existing in vitro testing strategies.","Hofer Stefanie, Stonig Marlies, Wally Verena, Hartmann Anja, Fuchs Dietmar, Hermann Martin, Paparella Martin, Ganzera Markus, Gostner Johanna M",ALTEX,2019,"Cell Line, Fibroblasts, Humans, Keratinocytes, Oxidative Stress, Radiation-Protective Agents, Reactive Oxygen Species, Skin, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30488083/,"Department of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.; Division of Biological Chemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.; Division of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.; EB House Austria, Research Program for Molecular Therapy of Genodermatoses, Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Austria.; Institute of Pharmacy/Pharmacognosy, University of Innsbruck, Austria."
36149470,Practical application of the interim internal threshold of toxicological concern (iTTC): a case study based on clinical data.,"We present a case study that provides a practical step-by-step example of how the internal Threshold of Toxicological Concern (iTTC) can be used as a tool to refine a TTC-based assessment for dermal exposures to consumer products. The case study uses a theoretical scenario where there are no systemic toxicity data for the case study chemicals (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, octinoxate, and ecamsule). Human dermal pharmacokinetic data following single and repeat dermal exposure to products containing the case study chemicals were obtained from data published by the US FDA. The clinical studies utilized an application procedure that followed maximal use conditions (product applied as 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 75% of the body surface area, 4 times a day). The case study chemicals were first reviewed to determine if they were in the applicability domain of the iTTC, and then, the human plasma concentrations were compared to an iTTC limit of 1 µM. When assessed under maximum usage, the external exposure of all chemicals exceeded the external dose TTC limits. By contrast, the internal exposure to all chemicals, except oxybenzone, was an order of magnitude lower than the 1 µM interim iTTC threshold. This work highlights the importance of understanding internal exposure relative to external dose and how the iTTC can be a valuable tool for assessing low-level internal exposures; additionally, the work demonstrates how to use an iTTC, and highlights considerations and refinement opportunities for the approach.","Najjar Abdulkarim, Ellison Corie A, Gregoire Sebastien, Hewitt Nicola J",Archives of toxicology,2023,"Humans, Benzophenones, Risk Assessment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36149470/,"Beiersdorf AG, Unnastrasse 48, 20245, Hamburg, Germany.; Cosmetics Europe, Avenue Herrmann-Debroux 40, 1160, Brussels, Belgium.; L'Oreal Research & Innovation, 1, Avenue Eugène Schueller, 93601, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France.; The Procter & Gamble Company, 8700 Mason Montgomery Road, Cincinnati, OH, 45040, USA.

10732449,Evaluation of the protective effect of sunscreens on in vitro reconstructed human skin exposed to UVB or UVA irradiation.,"We have previously shown that skin reconstructed in vitro is a useful model to study the effects of UVB and UVA exposure. Wavelength-specific biological damage has been identified such as the formation of sunburn cells (SBC) and pyrimidine dimers after UVB irradiation and alterations of dermal fibroblasts after UVA exposure. These specific effects were selected to evaluate the protection afforded by two sunscreens after topical application on the skin surface. Simplified formulations having different absorption spectra but similar sun protection factors were used. One contained a classical UVB absorber, 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate. The other contained a broad-spectrum absorber called Mexoryl SX, characterized by its strong absorbing potency in the UVA range. Both filters were used at 5% in a simple water/oil vehicle. The evaluation of photoprotection on in vitro reconstructed skin revealed good efficiency for both preparations in preventing UVB-induced damage, as shown by SBC counting and pyrimidine dimer immunostaining. By contrast, only the Mexoryl SX-containing preparation was able to efficiently prevent UVA-specific damage such as dermal fibroblast disappearance. Our data further support the fact that skin reconstructed in vitro is a reliable system to evaluate the photoprotection provided by different sunscreens against specific UVB and UVA biological damage.","Bernerd F, Vioux C, Asselineau D",Photochemistry and photobiology,2000,"Camphanes, Camphor, Cinnamates, Drug Evaluation, Preclinical, Humans, In Vitro Techniques, Mesylates, Skin, Sulfonic Acids, Sunscreening Agents, Ultraviolet Rays",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10732449/,"L'Oréal, Life Sciences Research, Clichy, France. fbernerd@loreal-recherche.com"
